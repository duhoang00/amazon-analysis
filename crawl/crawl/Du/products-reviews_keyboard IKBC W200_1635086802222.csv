However, as of recently (approx 8-10 months after purchase) the keyboard seems to be picking up a lot of wireless interference - keystrokes are either undetected or lag seriously at random moments.I've tried with multiple ports on my desktop (front/rear IO, USB2.0, USB3.0) but it keeps occurring, and the lack of a wired connection means that there's no real alternative to replacing it with a wired board. For people who know that they're using it in an area with reduced/no wireless 'noise', this is a great board - but if not, I'd suggest looking at something wired instead.

I did not know mechanical keyboards were a thing until this past month. I've been geeking out on them since, and have tried several, with wireless being my essential requirement.As keyboard geeks know, this limits the selection. I sampled several different brands (with Brown, Red, and Topre switches) but was not too impressed and sent each of them back. Some used Bluetooth and establishing connections was not always easy. The dongle/2.4 setup is best for wireless.These Cherry Blues are heavenly and this iKBC keyboard is the One. The wireless works perfectly with no perceptible lag when I'm typing at 100 wpm.

"R1EWIX4Y6FOEQW","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2021",5,"Small keycaps?Odd complaint","1.) ""Small"" keycaps.I was reading through the Amazon reviews on this keyboard and I was somewhat alarmed by the one that complained about the size of the keycaps.These keys are a very normal size.They width of the top of the key is .515"" according to my calipers (13mm).2.) With or without number pad?So I use this keyboard with either a mouse or a touchpad sitting just to the right of the keyboard.Since I use the mouse/touchpad so frequently, I find that the reduced distance I need to travel in order to get to the keyboard/mouse is wonderful, so I recommend omitting the number pad.I have a second keyboard that has a number pad that I can pull out if I have a bunch of number data entry to do, but for daily typing tasks, I don't feel like I'm missing much by not having the number pad.3.) Feeling of the key action (aka the switches).I got the Cherry MX brown switches.They seem great, but I'm not a mechanical switch aficionado.I would love to have tried them all out side by side, but I'm happy with the browns.They aren't too loud, but they're definitely not silent.My laptop keyboard and my other keyboard (Microsoft wireless bluetooth keyboard) are both virtually silent.4.) Typing speed.I type pretty quickly, and although I feel like I'm still getting used to this bad boy, I find that the responsiveness is very good, and I did a quick typing test online to see the how I was doing on the new keys.The Microsoft keyboard requires quite a bit of force to depress each key.The Cherry browns are definitely a much lighter actuation force.I found that I was immediately able to type about 15-20% faster which I attribute mostly to the lighter key actuation force and the solidity of the keyboard.5.) Build quality.Last thing I'll mention is that this keyboard is heavy.It feels well built and I suspect that it will last me for a long long time.Maybe (hopefully) a lifetime.6.) Scratchiness on the keystroke.There was a complaint from another reviewer that the keys felt a little scratchy on the way down as they are being depressed (They compared the feeling to another mechanical keyboard that they had used which felt ""silky smooth"").I notice this as well.I'm not sure if it bothers me, but I agree that it is noticeable.All that said, I have only had the keyboard for a day, so take it with a grain of salt.We'll see what I think in a year about this guy.",true,1,1,"10","B084GMXD3S","keyboard IKBC W200",false,96.99,"USD",0,0,0,58,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084GMXD3S","237.80",false,false,false,false,"iKBC W200 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Brown Switch for Windows and Mac OS, Enables Media Key and LED Indic...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TLUqMDYzL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R8YQ1G7VUH60Q","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021",5,"Phenomenal! ...But Takes Some Getting Used To","Okay so I absolutely love this keyboard, no doubt about that now. It wasn't like that at first though.I initially purchased the keyboard for my first gaming desktop PC (avid longtime PC gamer, putting in 80-90 hours every week on average back on my gaming laptops) and I liked the black/white aesthetic that matched my PC and speakers, but also because of its minimalist design and THE VOLUME KNOB <3Upon first getting it and using it however, I found myself accidentally pressing other keys by accident because they aren't spaced very far apart and don't take a lot of force to press. Honestly I almost considered returning it after a few days because I hated all the misspellings I was making and having to correct.After a few weeks of usage though I suddenly realised that I wasn't making misspellings hardly at all anymore and my fingers had already memorised the placement of all the keys so I don't even look at the keyboard when I type now.So for anyone who just got this keyboard and is having a similar issue, just stick with it for a few more weeks and I promise you it gets better! For anyone on the fence about it, just be aware that you may have this issue at first but like I told the current users, you get used to the keyboard after a short while!Alright here's the Pros/Cons list: The Cons: - The narrow spacing between keys can lead to some accidental key presses in the early days of getting used to the keyboard - It isn't wireless (this may or may not be a con for some people, I personally don't care much) - Um... I think that's it?And the Pros: - Typing is pretty quiet compared to a lot of other keyboards! My roommate said he was glad I switched to this keyboard finally just because he could finally read in peace haha. Combine this keyboard with the Emopeak silent mouse and you've got a nice quiet setup, though that mouse may be a bit small for some people. - The ever-so-silky smooth volume knob! I honestly can't get over how nice the knob is. It has the perfect amount of resistance when turning it, its metal construction makes it feel very premium, and if you want to mute the volume, you can just press it down to mute instead of turning the knob to the left. I refuse to get another keyboard that doesn't have a volume knob. - The individually-backlit keys! There's plenty of lighting pattern customisation, from the speed of the animations to the brightness as well---and of course there is the ability to have the keys constantly illuminated or not at all. - The ability to set a PIN to unlock the keyboard when turning it on--to prevent any unwanted users accessing your keyboard/PC - Low profile makes it a good entry-level keyboard for long-time laptop users wanting to get into the desktop world. - Very portable since it has a low profile, isn't very large, and the USB-C to USB-A cable is detachable. - Media control buttons in the top right of the keyboard! I'd've preferred the Play button to be between the Previous and Next buttons instead of the button order being Play, Previous, Next. They still work great though and I love using these in conjunction with the volume knob when listening to music. - Also the calculator button, right next to the media control buttons. Didn't think this was something I'd put on the list of pros for a keyboard review but honestly I use it far more often than I ever thought I would. - Great build quality! I saw a previous 1-star review saying that many keys stopped working for them after a few weeks or months of use but I've been using my keyboard for 12-13 hours almost every single day now for over a year and I have had absolutely ZERO problems in all that time.So I'm not sure what that person may or may not have done to their keyboard or if they just happen to have received a faulty model but their case about their keyboard is definitely not something you should expect to find with your keyboard.Who knows, maybe they didn't read the manual and accidentally locked themselves out of their keyboard haha.Features: 10/10Ergonomics: Initial Use - 6/10, Later Use - 9/10Build Quality: 10/10 (so far still holding up with no issues whatsoever over a year later of constant usage)Portability: 10/10Would Recommend: 13.5/10",true,1,5,"14","B082FTSMNP","keyboard IKBC W200",false,94.99,"USD",0,0,0,51,3.9,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082FTSMNP","198.90",false,false,false,false,"iKBC Typemaster X410 White Backlit LED Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Low Profile Red Switch for Windows/Mac, Full Siz...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FSVQ1JkxL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

To many times have I gone from one video with super quiet audio to another that wants to blow my speakers. Having an audio dial that accessible is the solution I needed.Cons:I have at least three key switches that are causing issues after 3 months.The tab key either doesn't work at all or ""bounces"" (detects multiple triggers when only struck once) and sends multiple tab keys. As someone who uses tab to move between fields when filling forms and auto completing text, this has become quite a nuisance. Autocomplete in gmail has turned into auto-send an email before I'm done typing it.the shift key (and yes that non-capital at the beginning of this sentence is the issue) fails to work about one in ten times. Half the time I catch it and go back and have to fix it - slowing me down.The ""j"" key is super sensitive meaning if I brush it when putting my hands on the keyboard or while typing around it, I end up with a random j in the middle of the page.In short, I can't recomjmend this keyboard.

Enter the iKBC cherry mx red tkl keyboard. Even after using mechanical keyboards for almost a year now, I still prefer thesatisfying tactile feedback of brown switches, nonetheless, the typing experience on the iKBC takes a little getting used to if you are coming from more traditional keyboards. The 3 biggest differences for me were the height of the keyboard (very comfortable without a wrist rest), the size of the keys (they look like they have been squashed down by Wreck it Ralph) and the unique sizing of the spacebar, enter and backspace keys. The keycaps are not that great and have no texture on top. They are quite smooth and if you have any moisture on your fingers, it will show a glossy reflection on the caps. This keyboard is so silent, especially for a mechanical keyboard! and It comes with a volume wheel. This is the only reason I spend an extra $25 on this keyboard over another low-profile tkl that uses a micro usb connection.

Returned and getting the 915 with beautiful clicky keys.And since I got the combo. the MX Master is not a BAD mouse either... it's ergonomically fitting to my hand, a nice change to the sometimes too-small gaming mice that Logitech designs for my bigger hands.. But the side scroll is defunct and the forward/back buttons are literally on top of each other in a diagonal fashion. This makes it very tough to hit the correct button the first time. Worst of all however is the fact the polling rate is only 125hz. They say you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.. well with this mouse you can take 100 shots and miss a damn well lot of them due to the low rate. Again, returning this as well and getting the G502 wireless.Logitech needs to rethink their branding for this keyboard/mouse. You can even see from a lot of the reviewers here, this is ideally an OFFICE keyboard/mouse setup. Not a gaming setup! The gaming equivalents are the G915 keyboard and G502 or G903 or G604 or G703 or.. y'know what? There's a lot of good logitech gaming mice out there..

The switches would routinely duplicate the letters, and at one point even the backspace key failed (same style switch). Thankfully the switches are replaceable with a little soldering skill, but this is a real nuisance. Because I was in a rush (and thinking Logitech may have just gotten a bad batch of switches during assembly), I bought a second keyboard, identical model, different batch. STILL having switch failures. On the original keyboard I have now replaced a total of EIGHT switches, on the newer one I've had to replace two.Until/unless Logitech gets better switches I would avoid this keyboard. I didn't bother going through customer service because I knew I could repair this issue myself, but not everyone has the tools or is handy. If you're handy and don't mind replacing switches, I've otherwise enjoyed the keyboard. Keystrokes are nice, responsiveness is excellent, and the range of the wireless is great.

I have been hunting a descent backlit TLK keyboard with Cherry Silent Black switch type for years. Most MK doesn't offer this switch type, which leaves me frustrated. The moment I found this Durgod Taurus K320 TKL with Cherry MX Silent Black was the moment that a dream finally came true. Major keyboard companies would sell an MX silent red, a lighter version. Whereas the Silent Black variants usually lost popularity and went out of stock. What a nightmare for someone like me - someone who plays the heavy keys. Those butterfly red switches are just not my taste.Speaking of the build quality, the best descriptions are sturdiness and elegance. I love the font of the letters on the keycaps. They are simple, clean, and professional-looking. I seriously dislike the lousy and overly exaggerating fonts founded on the keycaps of other brands' gaming keyboards. The keycaps are a perfect fit for the Cherry MX switches, made of double-shot PBT. They feel great to type on. In sum, I love this keyboard for two reasons. First, it offers a rare switch I enjoy. Second, the build quality is excellent.One minor problem I have is that the included USB-C to USB-C cable seems to be flawed. It doesn't have a very stable connection to my laptop and randomly disconnects. Amazon resolved it for me by giving me a new USB-C cable for free.

"RMO9GLIWBKZ6Y","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2021",5,"One of my favorite keyboards yet!","Over the last several months, I've really gotten into portable mechanical keyboards. The K320 is my 5th such keyboard and is by far my favorite! Though more expensive than some other options,BUILD QUALITYWhile the frame is plastic, it's a very durable plastic that is quite rigid, giving an overall ""well-built"" feel. There's no appreciable ""deck flex"" even with good pressure. The included keycaps are solid - with some other keyboards that I've bought on Amazon, I've noticed that the keycaps can be quite thin - with clear printing. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have any issues with the quality of printing on some of the keys. The included USB C cables seem well-built, though braided cables would've been a nice touch. Overall, though, the board seems durable, and I'm not worried about its ability to stand the test of time. 5/5PERFORMANCEI went with the Cherry Brown switches. This is my first board with Cherry Brown switches and I absolutely love them! Very nice tactile feel with a satisfying - but not deafening - click. They're heavy - and I do notice that my typing is about 10% slower compared to ""faster"" switches - but for long typing sessions, I do prefer the heavier actuation weight of the Brown switch.Other than the switches, this board performs as-expected. I haven't had any issues with an unstable USB connection, missed key presses, or any other issues with the individual switches themselves. This board is an absolute pleasure to type with. In fact, I bought it originally for my office, but I ended up loving it so much that I took it home and used one of my other keyboards for my office instead.I didn't try Durgod's firmware update tool so I can't speak about issues related to firmware upgrades. I didn't really see the point since I didn't have any issues with the board out of the box. 5/5OVERALLIf, like me, you're on the quest for a perfect keyboard for your PC setup, put this on your short list. While I haven't entered the premium keyboard market - which I would define as $150-200+ - this is definitely the best keyboard in the $100 or less price point that I've tried so far.

Would be better if they were lubed. I don't notice while typing but playing games you can feel it and then once you do you can't forget about it.

Sort of removes any cost savings.For 100$ seems ok but would be way better of an option if it was hot swap.Lighting is good, key caps feel decent.

""The perfect amount of noise, the perfect amount of feedback, the perfect WEIGHT."" The construction is what you would expect from a keyboard in this price-point. It's extremely solid, stays planted on my glass desk. Nothing feels cheap about it. It's fairly heavy. There is a magnetic ruler that is under the keyboard that is used to prop it up. I wish there was more adjustability for keyboard angle but, I can't knock a star off for that. It's such a great experience. Also, the cord is slightly ridgid and has a fairly large diameter. To some this may not mean much but, it doesn't appear to be something fragile. As in, my 3 year old could drag the keyboard around the house by the cord and I doubt the cord would be damage at all. One thing I can add (that may be something to look at in future revisions of this keyboard) is about the 'sleep, mute, previous, play/pause, next' buttons. It would be nice if they had more of a mechanical feel too. I would love to try the different mechanical buttons from Das Keyboard just to compare them.

The cherry brown switches have a very light touch and soft tactile bump. If you have good form then they will work well. I am not a great typist so I tend to hit adjacent keys sometimes due to the high key height. Not the KB's fault. A good typist will love the quick feel and light touch. The fonts are very standard and easy to see.I noticed the ""s"" key started out scratchy but has improved after a few hours. I assume breaking in the KB will help but I would expect for the price all keys should be silky from the start. By scratchy I mean the key seems to have an annoying resistance/stick at the top of the stroke especially if you hit the key off-center. It is still about 50% noticeable after a few hours of continuous use.The height is adjusted by a ruler gimmick which now has feet to prevent sliding.
