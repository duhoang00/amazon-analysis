"R37NEA2RQ5YJM9","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2021",5,"Low profile high performance mouse surface","I bought this to replace an 8-year-old Razer Sphex skin, which was almost identical other than the size and design. The Sphex was being used on the tiny computer desk in our family room. I like having a low profile mouse pad on that desk which doesn't stick out. The Sphex did well considering how much use it got, and how my daughter liked to lift up the edges and crease them with her nails during online class until tiny pieces eventually tore up bit by bit.I like the design of these pads. The Sphex was accurately called a desktop skin, which is what it is. This new one's called 'thin mouse pad', which can be misleading. It's basically a piece of plastic that's smooth and tacky on one side (to stay in place), and textured on the other side to give good mouse performance. This new version has a cloth 'tag' that you can use to pull it up and reposition it. These are very easy to reposition, but only as long as you keep the tacky side off the table as little as possible so it doesn't collect dust, and make sure any surface you move it to is cleaned thoroughly. You also have to be careful not to crease it, since any crease on this material is permanent and will always show. For all these reasons, this is NOT appropriate as a travel mouse pad.I was initially worried that the design on this would be too bright, but the actual mousepad has more muted colors than in the pictures. Overall I highly recommend it.",true,1,1,"10","B01N7R3OZ9","razer sphex v2 mini",false,7.99,"USD",0,0,0,8364,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7R3OZ9","36801.60",false,true,false,false,"Razer Sphex V2 - Mini - Ultra-Thin Form Factor - Durable polycarbonate finish","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m7H-gPPYL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Il tappetino arriva con una pellicola super sottile e super trasparente applicata sul retro. Sembra che non ci sia! Per notarla e rimuoverla correttamente, bisogna guardare attentamente nel punto che ho indicato nella foto: vicino la linguetta Razer. Se non rimuoverete la pellicola che protegge lo strato antiscivolo, ovviamente il tappetino non sarà antiscivolo.Una volta rimossa, basterà pulire bene la superficie della scrivania, posare il tappetino e questo non si schioderà più (come si può vedere in video, dove scuoto la scrivania ma il tappetino non cede di 1mm!). Naturalmente è possibile sollevarlo intenzionalmente, sempre attraverso la linguetta Razer (non è adesivo!).✔️ Super veloce!A me piacciono i micro movimenti. Sono abituato da tanti anni a usare la massima sensibilità sui mouse proprio per muovere il meno possibile il polso. Per lo stesso motivo sono abituatissimo ai mini tappetini. La texture di questo tappetino è straordinaria. Sembra di poter far scorrere il mouse semplicemente soffiando.❗ Occhio ai piedini!La scorrevolezza dei tappetini duri si paga con un consumo più rapido dei piedini del mouse.Se giocate a sparatutto e, in generale, a titoli che richiedono precisione, vi serve attrito e quindi un tappetino morbido.

"R2E8KGC8ZDSBIJ","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2021",1,"Left-Click Stopped Working After A Few Months","I purchased this mouse for light gaming and typical web browsing. Within 6 months, I noticed the left-click was not holding down correctly. Physically it felt fine, but it was basically unplayable in games. I tried every solution and the problem only got worse over time so I figured it was a hardware problem rather than a software issue. I took great care of the mouse and used it VERY lightly yet it still gave out quickly. Not to mention the Razer Synapse program is terrible. Unfortunately for me, the company that sold me the product through Amazon, ""TECHLOBBY"", is not an authorized seller of Razer products so the 2 year manufacturers warranty did NOT cover this issue. On Razer's website, Amazon is an authorized seller of Razer products but many of the companies that sell through Amazon are not so it is very misleading. This mouse is no longer manufactured by Razer so don't even bother buying it.

Happily, in the 9 months of ownership I've had, I can report no warping of the mat: It's as flat as it came on the first day. (...it came rolled up, but.. you know)I like the Extended model for desk coverage. It adds a nice touch to your workspace, and has proven to be easy enough to clean with a damp cloth. The experience has been overall very good.Where it lacks is durability of the cloth skin on the mat. The right hand side (see pic) shows noticeable wear after less than a year of use. This was a disappointment, because if not for that fact I would have given this a no-fault review. A less important nitpick: The single channel EL strip, vs a multi-channel zone strip like what the Firefly uses to produce the wave effect. A mat this large would show off greatly if the EL strip could handle it, IMO.Pictures show a.) the spot on the mat where it's taken notable wear and tear, discoloring and fraying the fabric skin of the mat; and b.) a snapshot of my Goliathus workspace: From left to right: The Razer Charging Pad Chroma, the Blackwidow Chroma v2; the Mouse Dock Chroma; and the Naga Pro.

Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches.
