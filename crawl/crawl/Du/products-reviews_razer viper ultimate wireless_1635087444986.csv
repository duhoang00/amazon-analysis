"R3J3IMYAGLOT1U","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",2,"I hope you have big hands.","This mouse is definitely *not* for people who have hands on the smaller side of average. I don't have tiny hands by any means, but this mouse is extremely awkward for me to use without accidentally hitting the first row of keys on the side. My hand simply doesn't wrap around enough of the bulk of this thing to get a good grip on only the non-button portions of the mouse. This leads to firing off skills or macros that I absolutely do not intend to use yet while just moving the mouse around; I've had to disable the first row of keys entirely to avoid this.Another problem the size presents is that it won't consistently hold down the LMB if I want to click and drag; it'll often let go prematurely because my fingertips apparently don't reach far enough forward to get the leverage it needs to keep the sensors in contact.Years ago, I had a Naga that had plates you could swap out to adjust the size appropriate to your needs, but they apparently don't make them anymore, and are going with a ""one (large) size fits all"" approach. This is a major shame, because it's excluding a fairly significant portion of the gaming population.If you have big ol' hands, then I bet this mouse would work great for you.

Great if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate.","When compared to the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate , after 1 week of use:TLDR - Scroll wheel and LED upgrades are good.But... the +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. No way to adjust resistance.

The Basilisk's shape isn't as comfortable for my hands as that mouse, mainly because it's lacking a little in size compared to the MX. This mouse is much nicer for gaming though as there are more DPI options, and honestly the clicks seem a little more responsive for gaming.The software control for this mouse is good, but I feel it's not as responsive as the wired Basilisk V2 that I had was. This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly. Honestly, I think V2 looks a little bit more classy because it's not leaving an RGB shadow behind by default.Still I think the V3 is overall a better upgrade over the V2 because of the infinite scroll wheel.

The lighting on this thing is just mesmerizing, really vibrant colors, and a great brightness. Even though I got a stain of tea on it, it was relatively easy to clean, and the light took no damage what so ever. For US$60, is kind of expensive, but trust me, it is worth it.

"R3T18EQPLTDM9P","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2021",4,"A very fair mat solution, but wears quickly","So, I was turned off by all the reports of warping of the EL strips along its sides, but I took the leap and went for it. Happily, in the 9 months of ownership I've had, I can report no warping of the mat: It's as flat as it came on the first day. (...it came rolled up, but.. you know)I like the Extended model for desk coverage. It adds a nice touch to your workspace, and has proven to be easy enough to clean with a damp cloth. The experience has been overall very good.Where it lacks is durability of the cloth skin on the mat. The right hand side (see pic) shows noticeable wear after less than a year of use. This was a disappointment, because if not for that fact I would have given this a no-fault review. A less important nitpick: The single channel EL strip, vs a multi-channel zone strip like what the Firefly uses to produce the wave effect. A mat this large would show off greatly if the EL strip could handle it, IMO.Pictures show a.) the spot on the mat where it's taken notable wear and tear, discoloring and fraying the fabric skin of the mat; and b.) a snapshot of my Goliathus workspace: From left to right: The Razer Charging Pad Chroma, the Blackwidow Chroma v2; the Mouse Dock Chroma; and the Naga Pro.
