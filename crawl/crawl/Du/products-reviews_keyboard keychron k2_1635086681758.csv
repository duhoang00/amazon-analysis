"R21O5PWH3RJWTR","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021",5,"Solid Mac-first keyboard, with only a few caveats...","Since I needed new peripherals to go along with my new M1 Mac mini last November, after years of typing on flat MacBooks, I decided to finally treat myself to my first mechanical keyboard since the original IBM PC was offered with one.After a long online dive, when I surfaced I had decided on the 75% Keychron Wireless Backlit RGB with Brown switches and Aluminum Frame.For me, these Browns by Gateron are an acceptable compromise between mechanical feel and reasonable noise, just as long as you are okay with the lack any actual mechanical ""break"" when actuating. I prefer not waking up the house late at night!That being said, I do sometimes still miss a clearly felt mechanical actuation feel, but this works for me, and is still legions ahead of any membrane keyboard, or Apple's own.IThe keyboard is rather tall, but not exceptionally so.I use it with the rear feet extended for a more sloped typing angle, which helps.I ordered the matching Keychron Wooden Palm Rest in anticipation of this and it makes a big difference when I do serious typing.I also prefer the feel of the finished wood on my palms over spongy fabric covered palmrests, or the bare glass top of my desk. When just casually surfing the web or doing other non-typing-intensive tasks, I put away the palmrest since it just tends to get in the way if I have to move the keyboard around and have desk clutter.Bluetooth is rock-solid, with never a glitch or delay, ever.In fact the connection is far more reliable than with Apple's Magic Trackpad 2 that I bought at the same time.If I recall, I think I had to use a wired connection just once, to be able to boot up my brand new M1 Mac mini.This is a condition specific to only the M1 versions when using a non-Apple keyboard on a new machine.The RGB color options and patterns, though entertaining as heck at first, end up becoming more of a distraction after a while.I ended up using one preferred color pretty much all the time. Keyboard circus lights can be distracting!A note on the colors, specifically blue.Normally a color I might choose, this blue is not very bright, even when turned all the way up in the dark.I always end up using the brightest setting for all the colors, all the time, to get to a decent brightness level.Except for blue.I find it far too subtle.in my photos I use cyan/teal, which I like very much.Battery life with the RGB lighting activated is an issue, but it's addressed in the descriptions when you buy it.Expect to get a full day's use out of it, then plug it in overnight so you're ready to go in the morning.With the illumination turned off, it's much longer, maybe a few days.After nearly a year of use, I can say I am still satisfied with my purchase.I wish the lighting was a tad brighter, and the rubber on one of the folding feet has disappeared (a much bigger problem on the Keychron Palm Rest on which ALL of the pads slid right off it's base - a BIG problem since it'll wobble without!), but not enough suffer any buyers remorse.The keycaps still look good with crisp lettering, and they haven't acquired significant shine from use yet.Battery life is as purchased.it still looks and types great.Whether or not you consider it's reasonable cost vs. comparably featured keyboards from some others, it's a worthy purchase.Except for that one rubber foot-pad... When one falls off, you know more will eventually follow.Especially when you consider how awful they were on my Palmrest.I tried everything to get them to stick - unacceptable that they all fell off within a few weeks of purchase.Keychron, you make some good gear that I'm comfortable recommending to others.I want mine made right again; how does one get replacement feet, please?",true,1,2,"11","B07YB32H52","keyboard keychron k2",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,2623,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YB32H52","12065.80",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K2 Wireless Bluetooth/USB Wired Gaming Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys RGB LED Backlit N-Key Rollover Alumin...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614chmBNoqL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Been using a Kira for the past couple of years and before that, I had a crappy (but handsome) Excalibur 75% kb, this one is very nice. The only things I don't like about the keyboard is:- Lights reset whenever I switch machines or switch to Bluetooth. I have the keyboard attached to a KVM switch, whenever I switch the KVM to another machine. I'm not big on keyboard lights as I don't use shine-through keycaps. So it's pointless to have them on- Bluetooth is severely borked. It lags, types randomly by itself (usually the last key you pressed), its especially annoying when it gets stuck on backspace as it will delete everything you've typed until you hit another key.- The plastic case is plastic. I would have loved either a low-profile case or a metal one. I would have paid extra for either of those options. That being said, although it's plastic, and looks rather cheap, it's pretty solid and doesn't make weird plasticie noises when typing.If you use this keyboard with it plugged directly, it's great! Especially for the price. I highly recommend it if you are going to use it this way. But maybe do some research if you want to use this as a BT keyboard.

"R3KMVFMEQO7NHM","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2021",1,"Key chattering/duplication issue is a deal breaker, Drop doesn't stand behind their products","This keyboard looks good and feels solid with it's all-aluminum construction. If you purely use it for gaming you might never even notice an issue. But if you use it for any kind of typing - writing, coding, etc. - you will notice after a few months that it begins to exhibit an issue where keystrokes are duplicated. This is referred to as ""key chattering"" and if you search for ""Drop Ctrl key chattering"" you'll find that it's a very common issue with these keyboards, with no real fix. It makes this keyboard incredibly frustrating to use for work (coding) because it significantly increases typos due to the random duplicated letters while typing.Drop has released several firmware updates that they claim resolve the issue, but none actually do. They seem unwilling to admit that it's a hardware issue and continue to sell a faulty product. They also are not willing to provide support for the product when it's purchased from Amazon instead of their own website. Because of this, I'm avoiding the Drop brand entirely in the future since they seem unwilling to stand behind their products.There are a lot of good options for keyboards in the $100-200 range. This keyboard is already pricey for what it is, but the key chattering issue is just a complete deal breaker.

"R2MWVP81TRK45V","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021",3,"Wanted to love it but it just didn't work out","I was looking for a budget-friendly mechanical keyboard and really wanted to love the k8 as so many of my friends recommended Keychron as one of the best first mechanical keyboards for their price and quality. Granted the version my friends purchased was the K2, I wanted dedicated arrows and opted for the K8.First off, if based on typing alone... out of the other keyboards I've tried, I've mistyped the least on the K8. I actually truly enjoyed typing on here and loved that there was an option to level the keyboard. My fingers felt pretty natural typing and I haven't had to look down on my keyboard yet. The simple white backlight is nice, nothing too fancy like the RGB (which is nice to look at but my eyes will be glued to the screen and wouldn't be able to enjoy it anyways). My main intended use for the K8 was to be able to one day bring it to work and use it as my dedicated work keyboard.Now for the bad... as much as I love how my hands fall naturally on the keyboard... out of the box there is a persistent ping and/or squeaking on certain keys, wobble or rattle on larger keys like the space bar. Also a little wonky connection when using Bluetooth. Unfortunately for this keyboard set for the price, I was hoping to have a better experience. Unfortunately, it seems like I would have to do a lot of work on the keyboard to fix a lot of these QA issues. Another thing to note, although the keycaps feel nice to touch, with the matte finish you can clearly see your finger oils on them. Which again, is a bit unfortunate.Overall, I'm sure what I received could be a dud, I wouldn't take it out of the running completely. Still could be a worthy contender for an 87 keyboard.

"R26YTKL47B2YCC","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2021",5,"I love this keyboard and I couldn't be happier with my purchase","First of all, I'm no mechanical keyboard aficionado. It's just that I was looking towards mechanical keyboards because the keyboard I had been using had seen its better days behind it (Logitech K740), I was having trouble typing accurately on it, and I had heard so much about mechanical keyboards these days.What appealed to me about the K8 was that I could replace the keys and switches (I opted for Gateron browns), that it was backlit (I opted for the model with white lighting), the 10-keyless layout, and that it had Bluetooth support for up to 3 devices. This would allow me to easily switch between my Mac and my PC. The combination of this keyboard and my MX Master 3 mouse (which has the same ability to pair with multiple devices) has been a winning combination.I only use the keyboard for office type work (documents, programming) and also some creativity apps (Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere). No gaming to speak of.Things that I like:* The general feel of the keyboard. I can't explain it, but I find myself getting a certain satisfaction from typing on this keyboard. I find it strangely pleasurable. That may have more to do with the current state of my previous keyboard but the feeling is there nonetheless.* Backlighting. I often like to work with little light, so it is convenient.* Bluetooth. See above.* Comes with both Mac and Windows keys.* The fact that I can replace both they keycaps and the switches means that it should have a longer life, and I have more room for customization if I desire.* Has the ability to have the back of the keyboard sit at 3 different heights.Things I don't like:* It's very thick. I just got it and I haven't done any marathon typing sessions yet, so it remains to be seen whether I'm going to want to have a wrist rest. (My old keyboard had a bit of one built in, although it was really an ""edge of palm"" rest.)* It's really dumb the way the recharge cable is on the left side of the keyboard instead of the back of the keyboard.

Instead of going for the Thinkpad desktop version or the Logitech MX Mini, I went for the K3 brown optical switch version. The color indicates the type feel. Red=linear, blue=clicky, brown=tactile. The total travel distance of the keys are more than on the laptop but much less than a “traditional” mechanical keyboard. Felling wise, for the brown one, it is exactly what you would expect when you combine the laptop keyboard feeling between a good laptop keyboard and a mechanical mechanism. I ordered the red version first and was dissatisfied from the haptic feedback I got from the keys.Quality:The keyboard itself is simple and clean engineered. The quality seems on point and longlivity seems very likely. Due to the design and fact that the buttons can be removed the keyboard is easy to clean. I am sure even for the worst cookie monsters and chips eater will be happy. And if worst comes to worst it is possible to order a new set of keys directly from the manufacturer.Illumination:The light function is an extra gimmick but looks nice.

Oh well) and the reds were more expensive. I swapped them out for Kailh Speed Coppers. I didnt like the blues at all, but personal preference.This keyboard is excellent for typing. If you're into gaming, you may not like it. I haven't noticed any lag even on Bluetooth but according to RTings it's measured to be pretty high. You also don't have features like disabling the windows key or easy key remapping or macros.For work, though, it's awesome. Solid, good battery life (you can set it to never sleep automatically, default is sleep after 10 minutes and waking takes 5 seconds ish), no-fuss BT connection. Feels great to type on (I don't have a lot to compare it to), the keys don't rattle or ring a whole lot. The browns or reds should be quiet enough for most offices.One thing I was unpleasantly surprised by was the keycaps. I tried another keychron, with their stock gray almost blue-ish keycaps, and they felt great. I was expecting these to feel the same but they feel thinner and smoother. Not bad, but a little disappointing after feeling and expecting the other ones.Overall, you can't go wrong with this one.

The lights are nice, keys sound fine, the board feels sturdy enough. The problems arrive when you turn it on unfortunately.
