But specifically for my use case, there was a killer catch that made me return it the next day. That catch is that the keyboard is missing three keys on top of the home/end/inset group which are the print screen, scroll lock, and pause buttons. Honestly, I didn't even know they weren't in the keyboard to begin with, but only after I started using it, I found out that it wasn't there, which impacted my productivity heavily since I have them bound as shortcuts and macros for other programs. So for me, the removal of those keys was the killing catch, but to other people who may not care about the keys and only use the keyboard for gaming or everyday use that's not for productivity, then it would be a solid catch, but this keyboard just isn't for me. And after finding out that almost all Keychron keyboards don't have the three keys, I may not be able to buy any of their keyboards because of the loss of that feature.I even tried looking all over the internet for ways around it, but I just couldn't find a way that made it work well for my use case, so I just couldn't use it anymore, and therefore also don't recommend this keyboard for people who use those keys.",true,1,2,"11","B07YJSMNFL","keyboard keychron k1",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,331,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YJSMNFL","1456.40",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K1 87 Key Ultra-Thin RGB Wireless Bluetooth/USB Wired TKL Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, RGB LED Backlit Low Profile...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lyxQvdNRL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R1UFNS3D5W3QNJ","Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2021",5,"Excellent keyboard for both gaming and productivity at half the price","Picked up the Gateron Red version, and I am extremely happy with this purchase so far. The keys are nice and responsive, they feel great and the quality of the switches are consistent between the keys. The red switches are decently quiet while still being satisfying with a low clunk while bottoming out the key, and it is quieter then my previous keyboard which is a selling point for me. One weird thing was that when I pulled my keyboard out of the box, I had to push down about half of the keys to make sure they were fully seated properly, but that wasn't a big deal.I picked up a Bluetooth receiver for my gaming desktop to use it wirelessly and reduce the amount of cable clutter and it has worked excellently. I haven't had any of the common connectivity issues such laggy inputs, missing inputs, double inputs, and I have multiple other wireless devices at my desk. For gaming, there is no noticeable latency over Bluetooth, even in fast-paced and reaction based games like FPS's. As long as you're not a heavy competitive gamer where the additional 10-20ms of wireless latency of Bluetooth 5.0 vs a wired connection could be an actual concern, I doubt you will ever notice it, but if that is something you care about then just keep it wired.I spent a long time researching wireless mechanical keyboard for both productivity and gaming. It was between this and the Logitech G915.

First of it connects to Mac and windows with a usb-c cable (most keyboard in this price point use mirco usb) and it comes with a type a adapter if you don’t have a type c connection. Also it comes with a GREAT key cap puller incase you need to swap some keys out. But the best thing of this keyboard I would say is the feel and the sound. This is a true mechanical keyboard unlike the fakes around this price range so it sound really nice and smooth (or clicky if you choose brown or blue switches) and this keyboard has to kickstand options on it so you can choose the most comfortable way to use it. One thing I will say is if you hit a key a little to hard sometimes it will make a whiny high pitch clang which can be annoying at times but it rarely ever happens.In conclusion this mechanical keyboard is by far the best keyboard you can get for 50 dollars as it offers many good features 100 keyboard DONT have.

If you don't like RGB, you can save a bit, if you want hot-swappable switches, you can pay a bit more, it works well enough for Mac and PC, the build quality is fantastic.I'm docking a star for two things:- The switches are a bit squeaky (this model is Gateron Brown)- The dedicated Siri/Cortana key is stupid and should be hardware-mappable to something less stupid. Luckily AutoHotKey/Karabiner existThe RGB effects are 99% ugly and unusable, but some of them look really good. I'd love a software-based tool for selecting exact colors to match with other RGB hardware, but for a built-in toggle system it's fairly flexible.The keycaps looked a bit ugly in the photos, but in person it's actually a beautiful keyboard. The keycap build quality is clearly to the same standard as the rest of the build, but as I didn't like the look in the photos, I did also buy a cheap pudding cap set that I replaced them with. It looks great with both the originals and the replacement caps, though the spacebar has limited backlighting for the translucent keycap base (very common, not really an issue).I would 100% recommend this keyboard to basically anyone at this price point.

You get used to not having a number pad pretty quickly as long as you aren't working in spreadsheets all day-Lower profile than Keychron's K series keyboards which is nice if you type with your wrists resting on your desk.Cons:-There is a little more play in the key caps than the razer keyboard I own (which has stabilizers built into each key) but I got used to it rather quickly-It can be a tad bit noisy when typing hard and bottoming out the keys, which is expected at this price point. Still sounds nice overall.-No wireless connectivity, which may be a deal-breaker for some but wasn't something I needed.To sum up, I would highly recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for a solid all-purpose mechanical tenkeyless keyboard.

"R21O5PWH3RJWTR","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021",5,"Solid Mac-first keyboard, with only a few caveats...","Since I needed new peripherals to go along with my new M1 Mac mini last November, after years of typing on flat MacBooks, I decided to finally treat myself to my first mechanical keyboard since the original IBM PC was offered with one.After a long online dive, when I surfaced I had decided on the 75% Keychron Wireless Backlit RGB with Brown switches and Aluminum Frame.For me, these Browns by Gateron are an acceptable compromise between mechanical feel and reasonable noise, just as long as you are okay with the lack any actual mechanical ""break"" when actuating. I prefer not waking up the house late at night!That being said, I do sometimes still miss a clearly felt mechanical actuation feel, but this works for me, and is still legions ahead of any membrane keyboard, or Apple's own.IThe keyboard is rather tall, but not exceptionally so.I use it with the rear feet extended for a more sloped typing angle, which helps.I ordered the matching Keychron Wooden Palm Rest in anticipation of this and it makes a big difference when I do serious typing.I also prefer the feel of the finished wood on my palms over spongy fabric covered palmrests, or the bare glass top of my desk. When just casually surfing the web or doing other non-typing-intensive tasks, I put away the palmrest since it just tends to get in the way if I have to move the keyboard around and have desk clutter.Bluetooth is rock-solid, with never a glitch or delay, ever.In fact the connection is far more reliable than with Apple's Magic Trackpad 2 that I bought at the same time.If I recall, I think I had to use a wired connection just once, to be able to boot up my brand new M1 Mac mini.This is a condition specific to only the M1 versions when using a non-Apple keyboard on a new machine.The RGB color options and patterns, though entertaining as heck at first, end up becoming more of a distraction after a while.I ended up using one preferred color pretty much all the time. Keyboard circus lights can be distracting!A note on the colors, specifically blue.Normally a color I might choose, this blue is not very bright, even when turned all the way up in the dark.I always end up using the brightest setting for all the colors, all the time, to get to a decent brightness level.Except for blue.I find it far too subtle.in my photos I use cyan/teal, which I like very much.Battery life with the RGB lighting activated is an issue, but it's addressed in the descriptions when you buy it.Expect to get a full day's use out of it, then plug it in overnight so you're ready to go in the morning.With the illumination turned off, it's much longer, maybe a few days.After nearly a year of use, I can say I am still satisfied with my purchase.I wish the lighting was a tad brighter, and the rubber on one of the folding feet has disappeared (a much bigger problem on the Keychron Palm Rest on which ALL of the pads slid right off it's base - a BIG problem since it'll wobble without!), but not enough suffer any buyers remorse.The keycaps still look good with crisp lettering, and they haven't acquired significant shine from use yet.Battery life is as purchased.it still looks and types great.Whether or not you consider it's reasonable cost vs. comparably featured keyboards from some others, it's a worthy purchase.Except for that one rubber foot-pad... When one falls off, you know more will eventually follow.Especially when you consider how awful they were on my Palmrest.I tried everything to get them to stick - unacceptable that they all fell off within a few weeks of purchase.Keychron, you make some good gear that I'm comfortable recommending to others.I want mine made right again; how does one get replacement feet, please?",true,1,8,"17","B07YB32H52","keyboard keychron k1",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,2623,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YB32H52","12065.80",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K2 Wireless Bluetooth/USB Wired Gaming Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys RGB LED Backlit N-Key Rollover Alumin...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614chmBNoqL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I recently tried a number of cheaper membrane keyboards, but never found one that I felt at home on. I had started seeing all the hype and talk about mechanical keyboards and was curious as to what all of the fuss was about. After doing some research, watching more YouTube videos than I care to admit, I took a leap and purchased a Keychron K3.As far as fit and form is concerned, I can honestly say that I love this keyboard so far. I opted for Blue Gateron low profile, non-hot swappable switches as I figured if I don't really like the feel, I'd send back and try something different. I am in my own closed office space, so noise is not a factor. Though, I will have to mute my mic when in virtual meetings and need to type notes.Two not so positive observations:1) I had read a number of not flattering reviews regarding the Bluetooth connectivity. I have found that connecting to my iPhone is ok, though my Dell XPS 13 has not been so crash hot.2) this be a peculiarity of the Gateron switch, but when you press down a key past the 'click' point, and then partially release it back up, you can actually continue to press it all the way back down and register clicks. I was under the impression that it had to fully release and go back down past the 'click' point to register the next keypress.Other than that, the key layout is a little different that what I am used to. I find myself missing the Backace key and landing on the '=+' key.

The total travel distance of the keys are more than on the laptop but much less than a “traditional” mechanical keyboard.

The quality seems on point and longlivity seems very likely. Due to the design and fact that the buttons can be removed the keyboard is easy to clean.

The total travel distance of the keys are more than on the laptop but much less than a “traditional” mechanical keyboard. Felling wise, for the brown one, it is exactly what you would expect when you combine the laptop keyboard feeling between a good laptop keyboard and a mechanical mechanism. I ordered the red version first and was dissatisfied from the haptic feedback I got from the keys.Quality:The keyboard itself is simple and clean engineered. The quality seems on point and longlivity seems very likely. Due to the design and fact that the buttons can be removed the keyboard is easy to clean. I am sure even for the worst cookie monsters and chips eater will be happy. And if worst comes to worst it is possible to order a new set of keys directly from the manufacturer.Illumination:The light function is an extra gimmick but looks nice.

It needs to be more clearly advertised that the switches are not hotswappable. All switches are soldered on. Which is fine if this was a great keyboard out of the box, but:2. The stabilizers on this thing are BAD. Like, very mushy and unresponsive. The spacebar sticks constantly. Unless I absolutely slam it, I have a 50/50 shot of my keystroke actually registering. The other keys using stabilizers are mushy at best (e.g. enter, backspace, shift).The spacebar is relatively important, and the end result is a very bad keyboard. I will be ordering the hotswappable version direct from keychron's site because I think this would actually be a very good keyboard with upgraded stabilizers.

"R2ERQ372NMP7RX","Reviewed in Australia on March 24, 2021",,"Takes a little getting use to but it's a great little keyboard","These brown switches feel more stiff than the cherry brown switches I have on my corsair keyboard. But thats not low profile and so maybe thats the difference. Though it still feels like it's tougher than it should be.Otherwise this is a very neat nifty compact low profile keyboard. Loving it so far, been using it for about a day now and so far like the extra space and no numpad on the right.The low profile and space between the keys feel perfect otherwise.Notes for improvement:* Windows and Mac symbols on keys rather than actually having to replace them to get the symbol/icon for windows on them I switch between mac and windows very regularly and will not be swapping the key caps every time.* Some macro options without the use of software like the cooler master k622 does.* Though the width of the keyboard is great, I find I keep hitting the arrow key instead of the right shift. So maybe for me a layout like the K1 but with the low profile and design of this K3. Or better yet something in between as I would like the del and ins to be separate keys.Finally this would be 5 stars if the keys felt softer or not as stiff to press on these brown switches and insert and del being separate keys with a full width right shift key.UPDATE: Weeks of using it now at my primary keyboard.* Still find the keys a little stiff compared to my corsair cherry mx browns* Switch between mac and windows mode is very annoying and not very easy to switch. I switch between mac and pc very often. Wish the switch was like switching between bluetooth devices, or easier then the switch on there now. Though I'm getting use to it I feel like I'm going to eventually damage it and not be able to switch between pc/mac. Question is which mode will I be left in when that happens. Anyways, really hoping it won't get wrecked.* The size and spacing have been great.* The active bluetooth is wonderful, switching between devices has been instant once active.* Would have been nice to configure the idle time before it turns off. It also turns off after 10 mins when connected via cable and using bluetooth. And turning this feature off is not a good option as the battery has not been so great on this device.Hoping for a Keychron 3 rev 2 with the above addressed, be the perfect keyboard for me if that happens.",true,1,14,"113","B08LYL2N4S","keyboard keychron k1",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,26,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LYL2N4S","117.00",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K3 Ultra-Slim 75% Layout Wireless Wired Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys Bluetooth RGB LED Backlit for Mac Wi...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KT0A6-cjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2DE260I02162X","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2021",5,"Don't waste your money; barely lasted 5 months in one spot","It looks good, but it apparently wasn't meant to last. After 5 months of use, and experimenting with more than one bluetooth receiver on my PC, it just...stopped doing anything meaningful with my PC. It won't even stay connected anymore, and even if I perform a factory reset, trying to resort to its chorded mode doesn't make a difference (in fact, it seems to get very confused, and the light effects start to slow down in weird ways). The poor thing has basically spent 99% of its life on my desk in some capacity, never really travelling anywhere, but it alas just decided to start giving up on me.I want to like it. Sometimes, it does work. The keys feel great, and I'm happy with the form factor. But I think I've been patient enough with the device. It's clearly not durable, and your money is probably best spent elsewhere.",true,1,16,"115","B07ZT412V5","keyboard keychron k1",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,735,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZT412V5","3381.00",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K6 Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard with Gateron Red Switch/LED Backlit/Rechargeable Battery, 68 Keys C...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VC6EoVrKS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

It is in between blue and red switches.","Very good quality, compact and very fast for typing. It has the feedback like blue switches ( a bit less though), with far little noise. This has brown switches and that is what I needed. I do not use it for games. It goes to sleep mode a bit too soon. So, I decided to turn off this feature. The backlite is white only, which I like. I hate RGB and all the flashy colors for kids:-) It is very compact, but still has arrow keys which for me are very important. 10 out of 10 in my opinion.",true,1,16,"115","B07ZT412V5","keyboard keychron k1",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,735,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZT412V5","3381.00",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K6 Bluetooth 5.1 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard with Gateron Red Switch/LED Backlit/Rechargeable Battery, 68 Keys C...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VC6EoVrKS._AC_UY218_.jpg"
