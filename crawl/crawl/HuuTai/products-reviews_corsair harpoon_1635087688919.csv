"R3NGDI5C3VV8QO","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"TERRIBLE. Scroll Wheel WILL Start to Squeak and Fail After 3 Months.","For the first few months, it was good. Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches.

I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap.

"R36OOOSV99KWVV","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2021",4,"Good mouse, no doubt about it, but beware if you have larger hands","First of all I'll preface by saying that I'm unsure if the issue of my assigned keybinds resetting was an issue of ICUE software or if it's an issue with Windows 11. Either way, it's something to be noted that there's the possibility of your ICUE software resetting or scrambling your assigned keybinds when you reboot your PC. This issue won't affect the score I gave it since I can't pinpoint the exact cause of it.What will affect it however, is it's size. For a gaming mouse, the form factor is surprisingly small. I wear a medium/large size glove and this mouse was exceptionally uncomfortable if you're using it for it's defining feature: the programmable buttons on the left. In my natural mouse grip, my thumb rests on the frontmost row of buttons, making 123/456 the easiest to access. The 789 row just behind it is a bit uncomfortable to reach. The 10/11/12 row is very difficult without shifting my hand back on the mouse or curling my thumb too far inward, which is unnatural for me personally and made using the mouse significantly more difficult than I had previously expected. And yes, this is with the number buttons slid as far to the front as I could with the adjustment screw.Additionally, the buttons themselves are very small and feature very little textural difference to help distinguish them besides some very light texturing on alternating rows. Pressing multiple buttons or pressing the wrong button is very common, more common than I would like. Between the buttons being small, being hard to distinguish one from the other, and having larger hands make utilizing the full potential of this mouse extremely difficult.Finally, the left and right clickers are very light. The weight of my middle finger alone is enough to cause the right clicker to go off.My verdict is that the mouse is potentially very good, especially if your hands are on the smaller side. Gamers with larger hands might find this mouse uncomfortable to use if you prefer to choke up on the mouse like I do. I wouldn't *not* recommend it, but I would definitely keep the size of the mouse itself and the buttons in mind when making the recommendation.",true,1,10,"19","B082LRMY53","corsair harpoon",true,69.99,"USD",79.99,10,12.5,1867,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LRMY53","8214.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite, MOBA/MMO Gaming Mouse, Black, Backlit RGB LED, 18000 DPI, Optical","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614J0VriTRL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The wire is high quality braided like all of their other devices. The software is simple and user friendly. The weights and software customization are incredible I like a heavy mouse and super low DPI for shooters with a high polling rate and this m65 is perfect. Just the right amount of buttons for the type of gaming I do.If you are a WOW or DOTA player you may find this lacking but this mouse is for FPS and other shooters. The sniper button is INCREDIBLY useful. I though of it more as a gimmick at first but no it makes such a huge difference in the fine aiming for high zoom weapons or vehicles.As far as ergonomics I have fairly large hands and it fits great. The thumb rest keeps your hand on the mouse and off the pad to make for smooth movement and less drag and the ability to change the weight is more valuable than I first assumed.I picked this up on sale and I think the price point is very fair for what you are getting.

Ergonomics are pretty good, but I find myself sometimes accidentally tapping the thumb buttons or the adjustment buttons under the mouse wheel. The mouse wheel developed a squeak after a month or two. The LEDs are obnoxious, unless you turn them down or off. Which you can do, but that brings us to the software.You must install the Razer apps in order to configure the mouse. You must register to Razer's site and log on via the app. Sometimes, the app forgets your login for some reason (I assume after an update), and you have to log in again. But the updates are the real problem. There are many, many software updates. When there's a new update, every time you log in to your computer, even after waking it of sleep, the big neon green Razer Central screen jumps out at you to tell you that there are app updates. ""Fine"", you think, ""I'll just disable auto updates""'. There's even an option to do so in the settings. The problem? It. Doesn't. Work. It will keep on pestering you every single time they release some update, which happens every week or two. And what's worse, every update requires a reboot. If you don't reboot? It will keep pestering you. Disable the Razer services? The big Razer logo on the mouse will glow a bright, neon green. I've seen discussions on the forums about what firewall ports to disable in order to prevent Razer's apps from phoning home, but that's really way more trouble than I'm willing to go through for a mouse.Simply the worst experience with software I can remember in a very long time.

"R1KB5A1RT2EY7S","Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2021",3,"Ok on a budget, but Of you can afford it, get a pricier one","Build quality is not great, feels light and flimsy. It is now 2 years and 4 months since purpose, and the microphone has totally failed (still sounds great though.I am a big fan of Corsair products but this is one of their budget items and it kind of shows when you have it in person.Verdict: decent cheap option for a gaming headset, but it will not hold up to any kind of abuse and don’t expect it to last for 5 years.",true,1,17,"116","B08S8NRWFG","corsair harpoon",true,86.83,"USD",99.98,13.15,13.15,1493,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08S8NRWFG","6270.60",false,false,false,false,"Corsair HS60 PRO - 7.1 Virtual Surround Sound Gaming Headset - Carbon & Harpoon PRO - RGB Gaming Mouse - Lightweight Desig...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516+0QMfMIL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
