My main gripe was that the fan profiles reset every time you plug in or remove the charge and you have to manually set it to what you want every single time. I ultimately ended up giving up on getting it to work properly and switched over to using a 3rd party software.-Battery life is average at best, I get around 6 - 7 hours of battery life doing moderate web browsing and coding after the latest BIOS update which is enough for me to get by but I would have preferred to get a couple of hours more especially considering that this model has a 99kwh battery.-The screen hinge can be a bit to the wobbly side but it doesn't wobble during normal typing so it doesn't bother me too much.In conclusion, I am very satisfied with this laptop but I wish they would improve their software.",true,1,1,"10","B093Z1FZV7","laptop gigabyte aero",true,1449,"USD",1799,350,19.46,32,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z1FZV7","131.20",false,true,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 15 OLED KD - 15.6"" UHD 4k AMOLED IPS, Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU 6GB GDDR6, 16GB RAM,...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pZxA3UiRS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R3BBRLYMC7FCZD","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2021",3,"Underwhelming","Purchasing this laptops is another testament to the fact that good specs don't always amount to a great product. I was deciding between the Gigabyte 17"" and a MacBook Pro 16"" and finally picked the AERO because of it's impressive screen and graphics card. Needles to say I'm experiencing buyers remorse.The Bad:Horrible webcam/nosecam: I don't know why Gigabyte decided to even include this monstrosity. It's completely useless as it gives everyone in your Zoom meeting a detailed look up your nostrils. The cam is mounted in the body so it's not adjustable unless you raise the entire laptop. In the world of remote work a good, usable webcam is a MUST. Dishing out 2500 bucks and realizing that you still need to by an additional webcam to mount on your screen is a joke. GIGABYTE PLEASE FIX.Charging port: It’s located on the right, middle of the laptop which interferes with your mouse, if you have a tight space and are right-handed. Most coffee shops I go to have tiny tables and given the size of this 17.3” laptop there’s very little room.Battery life: I’m a graphic designer that works in 3D occasionally. When I use Photoshop/Illustrator and Dimension I can’t get more than 1 hour of battery life out of this thing even in power saver mode.Screen changes brightness: Yes, it will go darker or lighter without you touching any settings. Not the end of the world, but annoying.Screen goes black: I’ve used this laptop for a month and so far I’ve had at least 5 instances where the screen goes completely black for a second or two. Gigabyte WTF?Annoying keyboard: I’m used to Macs where to change volume you hit F11 or F12. In this thing you have to hold down the Function key in order to adjust volume, so it becomes a two handed operation. I find this really annoying as volume setting is something that is the most adjusted function and needs to be as intuitive as possible.RGB keyboard: This is a Creator’s laptop not a “gamer” laptop. Having the keyboard pulse like a rainbow on acid is not only distracting but also extremely tasteless. If you want to compete with Macbooks please get rid of this gimmick that appeals to 12 year olds.Now the Good:This thing is fast.The screen is beautiful.The GPU kicks ass. It’s 10 times (10!) faster at rendering 3D than my 13” Macbook pro.It’s relatively slim and not too cheesy looking (minus the RGB keyboard) which fortunately you can turn off.About $2500 cheaper than a similarly spec’d out Mac. Mac’s however have better ergonomics.Ports. Useful, but because of its shortcomings I have to use up one USB port for an external cam and another for a mouse. So it’s a mixed bag.Summary:This laptop is good if you keep it plugged in all the time and use it like a desktop. Hauling it around and working on the go is not a real option as you only have about an hour. Gigabyte needs to put more into their product usability testing.",true,1,2,"11","B093Z1PWCF","laptop gigabyte aero",true,2099,"USD",2499,400,16.01,12,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z1PWCF","44.40",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 17 HDR XD - 17.3"" UHD 4k IPS Anti-Glare, Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, 16GB R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vGsA5sVuS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

This laptop cold boots in 7-10 seconds. It can easily do heavy load multitasking (even with the 16GB Ram). I'm not a real gamer, so I cant comment on that. However for Photoshop, Autocad and 4k movie editing this laptop has way more then enough power to handle.The fact that this has 4k HDR display is crazy to me. This display is literally breathtaking. The HDR is ""Entry level HDR"" so it's not like my TV but to have this on my laptop pictures/videos looks amazing!(1 month update)This laptop after a month is perfect!, I only ran into one issue after installing GEFORCE EXPERIENCE... it causes random BSOD. Unistalling it fixed everything.I did one additional upgrade to 64gb RAM. The 16gb that comes with is probably good enough for the average user.. but I'd recommend atleast upgrading it to 32gb eventually.It is very quite when doing websearching, youtube watching, Autocad or even video/photo editing.When my son used it for minecraft, you can start hearing the fans spin after the laptop starts heating up.... nothing too loud though.(2 Month Update, Final update unless something happens)So after using it for a couple months I realized when using the Laptop on battery once in a while the screen would flash black randomly. This is easily fixed by updating the Intel graphics driver to the newest (As of this review the newest version is: 30.0.100.9805).One more thing for people that have problems with the keyboard settings not staying... update the Gigabyte Control Panel.

I am not sure if I am allowed to post the link here.--- Pros ---I'll never get tired of the screen. This thin-bezel 4K HDR Samsung OLED is pure bliss. Must see it in person to believe how good it looks.The processor is the absolute latest, fastest 8 core (16 thread) processor from Intel. It has the latest Gen 4 PCI-Express, supporting the FASTEST NVME drives and Thunderbolt 4 peripherals in on the market. This is huge for speed of devices attached, and future-proofs the laptop since this technology is new.It comes with a blazing fast boot drive. It's a PCIe Gen4 OEM 500GB Samsung 980 Pro. I am surprised this isn't mentioned anywhere. I only know because I opened the laptop and looked under the hood. This drive has nearly 6,800MBps of read speed(!) Fast as it gets!This is your serious daily-driver work laptop by day, RGB Goofball by night (if that's your thing). Gorgeous modern metallic body with nothing screaming GAMERRR.Putting this guy under heavy stress and I saw internal PEAK temperatures reach about 75C, yet the laptop itself was lukewarm at best thanks to nice cooling.I/O and Connectivity Galore. USB-C Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, Mini Display AND Wi-fi 6? Check.This Laptop is a combination of awesome little details that build to ""Almost Perfect"". I could be talking about it all day long and it wouldn't be enough. Definitively recommended and a Winner in my personal opinion. Did I mention anything about the OLED?--- Cons ---It's a RTX 3080 with 105W of power. Seriously Gigabyte? The new ""Gamer-Focused"" Aorus 15P has 130W and this professional content creator gets stuck with just 105W? Maybe I'm just being petty.The Webcam angle is... depressing at best (it's positioned at the top of the keyboard, aiming up). At least I will know if I have BOOGERS during an online conference.The charging port is at the right side of the laptop. For more constricted work spaces like mine, it does rob valuable space to where the mouse could glide.The ""Gigabyte Control Center"" is good in concept, but bad in execution. It would be great if it didn't fail to remember keyboard lighting settings. Also the ""AI tuner"" banner pop-up is super annoying. It displays on screen every time you switch an application. And like the keyboard lighting, turning it ""off"" only does so until you reboot the computer. Once rebooted you must turn them it again. Annoying. I hope they fix this with an update.That's it. These are the only complaints I actually have of this guy in about a month of ownership.--- Overall Review ---This laptop is the latest money can buy. Has everything one could ask for and more. It truly has an unbeatable VALUE to what it offers and it sits at the very top of ""overall specs versus dollar"" list of any top-end laptop.",true,1,4,"13","B096TB8MRB","laptop gigabyte aero",true,2699,"USD",3449,750,21.75,7,3.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096TB8MRB","22.40",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 15 OLED YD - 15.6"" UHD 4k AMOLED IPS, Intel Core i9, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, 32GB RAM,...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812z-fFApyS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R3CD6S2YZE08XD","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2021",4,"Looks great and stays cool.","Over all a very solid machine. It's not perfect, but it runs great, looks good doing it, and won't burn you.2021 09 30 Update at the bottom.The Pros:*Very powerful CPU/GPU*Outstanding cooling system. So far the Aero 15 is running at least 20C cooler than my previous machine. Stock temps in the mid 40s, mid-high 70s under heavy load. I'd be surprised if I ever see this machine thermal throttling in anything remotely like a normal use case. Unlike my previous machine that would regularly hit 95C gaming. (see update about fan quality below)*The best looking screen I have ever seen on a laptop. Every other screen I have looks bland and washed out compared to this glorious 4k OLED. Pictures and reviews I've seen just don't convey how amazing it really looks.*Very good build quality overall.*Bright LED keyboard with a full numpad (fully customizable). Feels better than most laptop keyboards too.*2 RAM and SSD slots are easily accessible by removing the bottom plate (just one set of screws). Also got a thermal pad for a second SSD included in the box.*Built in sliding webcam cover. No need for tape on this one.*So. Many. Ports.The Cons:*The OLED screen is 60 hz. 4k 60 fps is great for most gaming scenarios, but I'd avoid this laptop if you absolutely need ultra high framerates, or want to play twitchy competitive shooters like CS or Valorant where more frames literally win games. The upside is that you can up the GFX settings more than on a higher refresh screen and still get the most out of it.*The OLED screen is not anti glare. There may be a technical reason for that, but regardless, avoid using this in bright areas, or while wearing any reflective clothing. It's reflective enough to be a decent mirror when turned off.*16GB of RAM isn't enough for a machine this powerful. Mine came stock with 2x8GB 3200 Crucial branded chips. They seem to be good RAM, just not big enough. It runs much better with 32GB 3200 HyperX installed. Can support up to 64, so there's room to improve when prices come down.*The built in webcam sucks, to be blunt. It's fairly low quality and poorly positioned. If you need a good webcam, hook up an external, there's more than enough ports to go around.*Gigabyte's Control Center software is a clunky mess, although it does have some useful features. Still not a fun experience using it though.*Unable to undervolt the CPU. This is more about newer chips than this laptop in particular, but I haven't found a way to do it safely.*The screen hinges are a bit weird. It's not loose or flimsy, but the screen can wobble a bit more than what I'd expect.*The function keys are horribly designed. The secondary function of each key is not illuminated, making it very hard to see in the dark. Sleep and Wifi are right next to screen brightness controls, and brightness up is on f4. I'm sure somebody has ruined their day by hitting the wrong button trying to change brightness. The fn key for keyboard brightness is the spacebar, and only has off, 'bright' and 'super bright' settings. For anything in between you need to use the software.*Built in speakers are mediocre. They're not too bad, but like the webcam, they feel like a cut corner compared to the higher quality of the rest of this system.Edit: A few observations after 3 months of use:* Gigabyte really cut corners on the fans. The cooling system works as well as I initially thought it did, but the fans themselves are low quality and wear out quickly. My GPU fan is already starting to wear out and produce irritating excess noise. There's no actual performance loss from it so far, but I've ordered a replacement fan.Dropped a star from 5 to 4 because of this, since after a bit of research it's been a persistent problem with the Aero series for years and remains unfixed by Gigabyte. This is the last place you want to use cheap parts. Inexcusably bad on a product that does so many things right.* I disassembled the Aero 15 for the first time to oil the GPU fan while I wait for the replacement, and I absolutely love the interior design. It's so well thought out and easy to tear down to clean or repair. The heatsink has numbered retained screws, and there are fewer screws than I'm used to seeing in general. Also no easy to break ribbon cables in sight. The downside, again with the fans, is that you have to remove the entire heatsink to access them, so I had to repaste as well.*Oiling the GPU fan reduced the noise it was making by about 80%. This isn't a long term fix, but it does treat the symptoms. Note that this is NOT something the typical end user should be attempting to do. If you aren't confident about your ability to open up a laptop this could be a much bigger problem that requires an RMA, and from what I've heard Gigabyte RMA is a horrible experience.*Also worth mentioning since I tried it, this laptop does not run well with Linux on bare metal. Maybe somebody more experienced with Linux could get it running good, but I couldn't. Stick to VMs or WSL if you need Linux on this machine.",true,1,5,"14","B093Z1JLHT","laptop gigabyte aero",true,2246.17,"USD",2999,752.83,25.1,10,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z1JLHT","42.00",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 15 OLED YD - 15.6"" UHD 4k AMOLED IPS, Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, 16GB RAM,...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pZxA3UiRS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

(You can't access the ports on the right if the power cable is facing frontwards.)2) The RGB per-key lighting is beautiful BUT the secondary characters (i.e., when you hit Shift) like for the lighting, sound and even common characters like ( ) @ # $ % on the number row do not light up -- they are not backlit! The problem (via Reddit) is that the Omron switches -- which have excellent tactile feel and travel -- have center lighting only. All right, but the printed secondary characters are done in a wispy light gray which you absolutely cannot see in the dark. (This is a poor design choice here.) They should be near white -- or at least reflect the light of the keys a bit. I just couldn't use this as a developer at night -- you'll need a separate light on to write / program at night. Of course, if you are a good typist, it doesn't matter for the common characters, but for the lighting, sound and other functions you aren't likely to know them by 'muscle memory.')Otherwise, an excellent laptop, but these are two hands-on gotchas you might not notice till you try this out this system in real life.",true,1,6,"15","B07SFR748X","laptop gigabyte aero",true,1599,"USD",1899,300,15.8,212,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFR748X","890.40",false,false,false,false,"Gigabyte AERO 15 OLED Thin and Light Laptop, 15.6 Thin Bezel UHD AMOLED Panel, i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX1660Ti,16GB RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NW5PsqpuL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Yes the fans will ramp up while gaming but it’s not a bad thing if you want cool hardware. I’ve heard no “coil whining” and had no issues with the WiFi. If you have issues with this computer it can most likely be fixed by tweaking the firmware and downloading drivers. If you are not at all tech savvy but still want to buy this computer because of the quality the first thing I would do is take it to a friend or someone that can find all the drivers for you and make all the adjustments needed to get this thing working to it’s potential, because once it’s optimized there’s no stopping it. Everything about this laptop screams “Cool”. From the way it runs, to the looks of the screen, the keyboard, and the logo on the back of the screen. The placement of the camera isn’t an issue if you don’t care about the views from your webcam, which I don’t. As far as gaming goes, I’ve run COD Black Ops Cold War (Multiplayer and Main Story) and No Mans Sky, both of which have worked great. May have to lower the video settings in the game itself to get the FPS up but it’s possible to run games at 70 FPS. Maybe my experience has been better than others but I would definitely recommend this laptop based on what I’ve experienced thus far. Will update the review if that at all changes.

I'm downgrading the review to 1-star due to product defects and shipping delays.Fairly soon after I received the laptop, I began noticing wifi glitches, resulting in wifi disconnecting for a few seconds at a time every few minutes. At first I thought it was my router, but after a few days the laptop kept having problems, while other devices on the same network were working perfectly. Product support had me reinstall drivers, then reinstall Windows, neither of which resolved the problem. The manufacturer was unable to provide an estimate for repairs and recommended I exchange the laptop through Amazon. Amazon support was very helpful in processing the return, however, a week later the replacement still has not shipped due to ""processing delays"". So I'm out $2k and three weeks later am still waiting for the laptop. I'll update the review when the replacement laptop arrives.Other notes:Screen looks good. Camera placement is super weird, but I knew that going in. Fans are on the loud side, but not too bad if you're just surfing the web or watching videos. Sound was fine.

"R187BJ056C691P","Reviewed in the United States on August 19, 2021",4,"Have had laptop {AERO 15 OLED XD) for couple of weeks. Lets call it a 4.5 star","I've had the laptop {AERO 15 OLED XD-73US624SP version) for a couple of weeks now.OVERALLDespite, missed opportunities in design and implementation, overall I am happy I got the laptop.I seriously love the OLED screen; cpu performance is right where it needs to be. I am happy with the 16 GB of ram and the 1 TB gen 4 SSD.For others who need more storage, the presence of the 2nd gen 3 SSD slot is a big plus. I expect this laptop to serve me well for long time. I guess I can love and still be aware of misses. As of this moment, I am still flipping on giving a 4 or 5 rating.A 4.5 would be comfortable for me to give.But then again my perfect laptop would have to be 6 stars. LOL.I decided to move this support warning from the bottom of the text to the top, because it really bothers that I cannot register the laptopSUPPORTI am perplexed. I have been trying to register the laptop for weeks now.Every link I have tried fails with most common error being 502 Bad Gateway. Does not matter which browser I try and have tried from multiple desktops and laptops. I have bought motherboards and graphics cards from them in the past. So I am surprised and disappointed that they no longer FULLY support their products.These are their own links imbedded in their own web pages.Yeah I expect they are going to reply, Don’t worry, we cover it etc. …… I understand that with Gigabyte being hacked, the company may be distracted from maintaining the business. It reflects badly upon the company.SCREENI love the 4k screen with its high resolution so I can have plenty of open windows and because of the crisp text I can still clearly read data. Basically I can lay panels out on the 15 inch screen like I would for my 27 inch monitor and still read just as well.Most people won’t care but data hogs will be happy. (if you are one, you will know what I am talking about.) Being a 4K screen, Windows will be “suggesting” a 250% scaling which I have dialed back so I can fit more on the display. I have not found any flaws in my display such as dead pixels or backlight issues or bleed. Movies are gorgeous, crisp and bright BUT there is a but.. see section on speakers.KEYBOARDVery Decent. A bit of concave shaping helps center fingers. The little locator bars on the J & F help touch typing and a light bit of bounce and key travel helps.Better than keyboard on my old asus . About equal to my old old Toshibabut not quite as nice of the feel of my Lenovo TabX1. A Plus for the AERO, there a real 10 key pad (sadlylacking on the TabX1 due to size). The backlighting is a BIG plus. I have used the control center to zone the colors and brightness for alphanumeric, function keys, control keys and the ten keys.Whoever decided to NOT include the shifted characters for the backlight needs to be wacked up the side of the head. Duh… Guess I will have to keep a flashlight with me at night.SPEAKERSBluntly barely adequate. The listening environment has to be totally quiet.If there is noise such as a fan in the room then the Volume on every setting from Windows, to the player or video application has to be at maximum. I tried to watch a movie and had to turn off a room fan (it’s August).While I couldhear strongly spoken dialogue, anything whispered was totally lost and I had no idea of what was said. Gigabyte brags “DTS:X Ultra Immerse yourself In Cinema Grade Sound” So external speakers or headphones are going to be needed. Hooking up a good Bluetooth speaker solved the problem for the movie.DOCUMENTATIONNot as good as my prior Gigabyte experiences. When I found the manual on the hard drive I thought I was in good shape.Nope, it was just a soft copy of the 2 page quick start guide.So online you will go hunting.Some specifications are there on the sales portion of the Gigabyte site. I am making a offline copy of the Gigabyte info, just in case they delete the info. Then there are a few third party review sites that cover technical data for the laptop.NOSE CAMIf you have already read or watched the reviews available, you already know the camera placement and quality are such a mess that Gigabyte could have and should have done better right at the beginning of the design and layout planning.I knew about it before I ordered and I will never ever use it.

I've had this laptop for a little over three months now and have now started getting the dreaded BLUE SCREEN! This is my work laptop and so I don't use it for any personal gaming/activities. This is pretty disappointing considering the fact how expensive it is.Changing my 2 stars to 1. Would give it half a star if I could. Ultimately it's your money and your choice but my suggestion is DO NOT BUY!So the main reason that I got this laptop because I needed a work computer with a long battery life. I have a desktop for all my gaming needs. When i first received the laptop, I noticed that the seal was already coming off, as I was excited about the laptop itself I just brushed it off as perhaps shipping issue. As I turned it on and got everything set up, I was pounded with notification to download a bunch of things that I didn't need or seemed fishy. I opted to just reset the laptop and delete everything. Hopefully it hasn't been tempered with....I've had the laptop for two weeks now and I have to say that I am quite disappointed with it. The feature that I was looking forward to most which was the long battery life does not live up to what it says. I get maybe 3-4 hours at most with a full charge with just watching youtube/prime movies and doing some work. I haven't tested out the gaming capacity side of this laptop yet so I can't comment on that too much but I did try running two instances of Bluestacks at low settings and it lagged both of them pretty hard.

High-speed hardware and a great price for one of the few laptops with a 4K display, let alone a nice OLED one.Unfortunately, every time I try to play a game on it with a second SSD installed, it'll decide to cut my internet speed down by 90% or more, if it even stays connected to the Internet in the first place. On top of that, it'll sporadically disconnect from any peripherals I use with it, including mice, headsets, external keyboards, wired or wireless, it'll get dropped if that second hard drive is in there.I've already sent it in once, and when I got it back and the issue showed up again after only a couple of days, I tried to troubleshoot it more myself so I could provide Gigabyte with more information. However when I went to try and submit a second RMA request, I found my login information was suddenly not on file, even though I've already sent it back to them once. No big deal, seeing as I can make a fresh account and go from there, right?Wrong. Now the serial number that was fine before is registering in a different country, and I cant get my RMA request processed regardless.If you're getting this for streaming or for business, you should be fine. But if you're looking for a great new gaming laptop, this thing will make you regret buying it.Seeing as it's still under warranty, I'm still trying to get this laptop either replaced or my money back. But seeing as their tech support is apparently so swamped that they can't get to me in a timely manner or bother their specialists to actually call me back, and submitting an e-ticket usually takes a week or more to hear back, I'm hoping this review gets their attention and we can get this problem solved once and for all.All I can really say is buyer beware.

"RH794WO2HJH2O","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2020",5,"Great laptop, but some weird software","I got this laptop for work and to play games while I travel, and it's awesome! It looks and feels like a professional's machine, not a gamer's toy, so it fits into any kind of working environment. Aluminum chassis, sleek black design, no excessive RGB lighting.It has a lot of useful ports and little need for dongles. The two USB-Cs were a nice touch. One of them will fast-charge my cellphone, which is a huge plus for me when on the go.The POWER of this machine is awesome. Even though its light and small, it can run VR games at full FPS, supports raytracing, and can run Unity, Slack, Visual Studio, 24 VNC clients and compile video at the same time. Can't believe this thing's got an i9 AND an RTX 2070 for under $2k. Be wary though: when this thing gets going, it gets HOT. You can't do real work / gaming on your lap, and I nearly burned myself touching the underside when I needed to move it.I haven't really tested the battery that well, but I did manage to do some off-and-on video editing / web browsing for about 4-5 hours before needing to charge. But as you should know, that kind of battery life is not going to last for long.The only problems I've had, other than its hot-to-the-touch underside, is the pre-installed software. As a tech pro, I'm okay with handling some of the hiccups, but others might have problems. First, the ""A.I."" it has installed is handy at times, an annoyance at others. You can read about it elsewhere, but my two cents: It's really cool how it handles power regulation for different apps so you don't have to. I was also pleasantly surprised when it changed my keyboard lighting based on what game I was playing, all automatically. However, the program is a bit CPU intensive, and it will override settings that you don't want it to touch, so you'll have to configure it accordingly; however, I usually just turn it off 100% to avoid fiddling with settings and to get some CPU utilization back.Most of the pre-installed software is just no use to me at all, and usually just cause annoyances. These can be easily uninstalled, but if you like a crystal clean machine upon purchase so you don't have to do anything (which doesn't really exist for current PC's anyway), you're gonna have a bad time.Also the camera is bad, but pretty on-par as far as laptop PC cameras go. I never use it, so it's fine for me.BOTTOM LINE: if you're thinking about getting a Razor Blade or an Alienware m15, seriously consider getting this.

"R2URBAA8W6BNAL","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020",1,"Terrible Fan Issues and Customer Support","Bought this laptop to use for college and games, and was extremely happy at first. After about 3 months of normal use, the GPU fan starting making an awful grinding sound. After getting to school, the fan eventually stopped working completely, causing the laptop to overheat and crash when doing things as simple as web browsing. Communicating with Gigabyte took 3 or more days between responses, and ended with having to pay $100 in shipping due to the warranty being limited, not full. It took nearly a two weeks (aside from shipping times) for a simple fan replacement that would likely take a technician no longer than an hour. During this time I had to work out getting a temporary laptop to use for school, which was an ordeal in and of itself.After receiving the laptop for the second time, it worked perfectly and I was once again happy. It is now 1 year later, and the other fan just died. The warranty only lasts a year, so it's up by now. I could easily do the replacement myself, but Gigabyte is stingy with their parts and I can only find a replacement fan from a third party for $85, which is far higher than the actual value of the part. After lots of research last year and this year, this seems to be a relatively common problem with the Aero 15 series in general. Despite loving the laptop when it works, this experience has prompted me to never want to buy a product from Gigabyte again.Don't be optimistic, don't be fooled by the generally good specs, don't take a risk, and don't waste your money; a laptop of this price should absolutely not have problems as simple as these, with such poor customer support to back it up.

"R3BKYEQS6DWVN1","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2020",3,"Rough edges overwhelm an intriguing idea","When I was looking to purchase a new laptop in early-mid 2019, my desired features were for it to be relatively thin and light while still holding a discrete graphics card, have a Thunderbolt 3 port (or more), and ideally have a monitor with good color reproduction.My intended use was primarily for gaming, but I was also looking for a portable workstation for photo and video editing.Unfortunately, most Windows laptops don't have Thunderbolt, end of.Of the few that did, most had only one, and often it was only available on models with lower-end processors and/or no discrete graphics card.And even the tiny number that checked those boxes generally had TN panels with limited color accuracy.So my selection was fairly limited.The AERO 15 seemed to have (most) of the specs I was looking for.And the new line had OLED displays that promised superb color accuracy.While the price was certainly higher, it had the best combination of size, weight, processor/GPU, and monitor available.Plus it had two M.2 slots for PCIe SSDs (another rarity), and seemed to be user upgradeable with relative ease, which was important given that the models available paired memory and SSD upgrades with faster processors and GPUs.Sadly, reality is much harsher.The problems started immediately.I had read that the AERO series could be finicky about the RAM it took.So after extensive research and finding lists of apparently compatible RAM on various forums (absolutely no official statement from Gigabyte, only supposedly official lists of compatible RAM provided by tech support and posted on forums), I selected a set that seemed to offer the best price/performance ratio for the range in which I was looking, and ordered it at the same time.After booting the laptop up the first time to confirm it worked, I powered it off, flipped it over, and began the laborious process of removing all 12 screws from the backplate.It took a bit of work with a spudger, but the backplate came off to reveal a fairly good arrangement of internals.It was a bit disconcerting to find that the thermal pad on the SSD had been folded in application and was mostly just scrunched up between the end of the SSD and the backplate.But nevertheless, it was easy enough to pop out the stock DIMM and replace it with my new paired set.Screwing everything back together, I plugged in the power, hit the power key, and...nothing.The laptop would not post.So out with the screws again (that was dumb), off with the backplate, double check that everything is seated properly, and nothing.One more attempt for good measure, and I decide to swap back to the original DIMM to make sure everything should work.Yup, no problem.So I spent several hours over that night and the next day trying to get my RAM replacement to work.I had a partial success fairly early on, when I got it to post with the original stick (8 GB Samsung) and and one of the new ones (16GB Corsair).Of course, it was then running both DIMMs at the slower speed of the Samsung, and there was no reason I should run a mismatched pair.So I pulled the Samsung and put in the other Corsair, and was right back to the black screen of futility.Eventually, I gave up.Some of that was forced, because I'm pretty sure I fried the Samsung DIMM by accidentally hotplugging it.How was it an accident?Well I forgot another fun feature of this laptop.It won't shut off.See it refused to post with the Corsair memory, but it still powered up, spun the fans, all that jazz.And when it didn't post, I'd hold down the power button to force it to shut down, and it would.And then, sometime in the next few seconds, it would start up again.And I was impatient, and wanted my relatively expensive laptop to work, so I didn't disconnect or discharge the battery, and I wasn't quite fast enough in swapping DIMMs before it powered on again.So I discharged the battery overnight, tried again the next day in every combination I could think of, and gave up and ordered a pair of the same model of Samsung memory it had come with.When the memory arrived, I inserted it, flipped the laptop over, hit the power button, and it was fine.Actually I think it made my heart sink by not posting the first time, but at the second attempt, it booted fine and I've never had an issue with not booting due to RAM since.Which brings me to the experience of using it.It's...fine.Gigabyte packages it with several control panels that are supposed to make customizing everything and getting the most out of it a breeze.From other reviews I read, this is a bit hit or miss, and it mostly just got in my way when I didn't actually want to make changes.It is a nice package - mostly black, no gaudy trim with the exception of the faux-chrome ""AERO"" plate between the rear heatsinks, and while it does have a giant AERO logo in LEDs on the lid, at least they're white.I had/have no complaints about the speed, though I haven't really pushed it.The fans are loud when they rev up, which is most of the time, though that's partly due to my leaving it on a fairly aggressive cooling setting.Crapware is mostly nonexistant (except for the unavoidable Windows stuff).But it's not just the firmware that has quality problems.The hardware also apparently has iffy quality control, as I've discovered today when my GPU fan bearings failed.Even if Gigabyte would still honor the warranty (if it even still falls in the warranty period), their RMA process is infamously bad, with every forum discussing issues with Gigabyte full of posts about a complete lack of communication from customer support.So where do I go from here?Would I recommend this version, or a newer one, or would I buy a Gigabyte laptop again?I'm not sure.When it was working, I quite liked it.But, purely anecdotally, every other laptop I've owned has just worked.I didn't have the stress of wondering if I had just sunk thousands of dollars into a fancy paperweight with other brands, just because my memory wasn't on a super secret list of four models (not even just brands; specific models) that would work.While they've worn out and/or gotten slower, that was after three or four years of hard use, not one.And I have no confidence that, if there had been a serious problem during the warranty period and I had wanted to return or get it fixed, that I would have had any success doing so.So I guess the tl;dr is:If you do plenty of research about the specific model you're looking to buy to find out exactly what parts you can use to upgrade it, and if you're willing to fly solo and/or with the help of random (helpful and kind) people on the internet, and if you're ok gambling that you won't have any major part fail quickly (but not so quickly it can be warrantied), then yeah, go ahead and get this (or a similar) laptop from Gigabyte.But if not, then I'd say it's worth whatever tradeoff there may be in increased price (potentially Razer) or slightly worse specs (Dell, several other brands) is probably worth it to avoid a brand and line that has so many issues.",true,1,16,"115","B07SHJXNBL","laptop gigabyte aero",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,78,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SHJXNBL","288.60",false,false,false,false,"Gigabyte AERO 15 OLED SA-7US5020SH 15"" Thin Bezel Samsung UHD Amoled, i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, Samsung 8GB RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eTChBKn5L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The one thing I would say that bugs me about the design would be the camera location. But, of course, if you want no bezel, you need to put the camera somewhere, and a camera down there is better than no camera. The access to the internals is pretty easy but you need a T6 screwdriver to access it. The main problem with this laptop would be the detection of memory. I bought the 16 GB memory variant but I wanted to take it to the max with 64 GB. However, I found out how hard this is very soon. The BIOS has a very hard time recognizing what ram is put in. For example, if I were to take out the existing ram and put it back in, it had problems booting up; I would be met with a black screen that keeps running the fans on high. If I were to try to force shut it down, it would just turn back on. Which made it pretty damn hard to swap ram as I was afraid offring the entire laptop. I just had to keep taking it out and putting it back in for it to recognize the ram and now I am set with 32GB and I gave up on putting the other 32 in there for a while. I have submitted a ticket. will update on how that goes. The other one thing that kind of annoys me is the battery life when doing anything other than standby is pretty low when compared to their claims but not bad nevertheless.Overall, I am pretty happy with my purchase and the 240HZ panel is a beauty to work on and game.",true,1,16,"115","B07SHJXNBL","laptop gigabyte aero",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,78,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SHJXNBL","288.60",false,false,false,false,"Gigabyte AERO 15 OLED SA-7US5020SH 15"" Thin Bezel Samsung UHD Amoled, i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, Samsung 8GB RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eTChBKn5L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2U742V21LYSYF","Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2020",4,"Manual Adjustments Needed!","I had a Surface Book 2 before this one, but this OLED screen is probably the most beautiful laptop screen I've ever seen. Performance is good, but there's one MASSIVE CATCH.THERMALS were terrible, sitting around 52 *C on IDLE and upwards of 90 *C under load. Fans were ALWAYS running and very loud.I was about to return this until I tried to manually adjust a few things as a last effort (through Windows Apps only, I did not touch any hardware stuff since that may impact the Warranty/Return Policy). I have this laptop for only a few days, so take this with a grain of salt. I'll try to update if something comes up.First, you need to finish all of your Windows Updates.Then download Gigabyte Control Center from Gigabyte website if you don't have it already. Update every driver available through there. Then here's the tricky part. Refer to online threads (aka Google search) if you are not familiar.1) Go to Nvidia Control Center. Under Manage 3D Setting, change Power Management Mode to Adaptive.2) Open an app called Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (should be installed along with Windows Update, but download if you need to). Undervolt CPU Core and CPU Cache by 100 mV (-0.100 V). Decrease Graphics Ratio Limit by 2 units.3) Go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Battery Options > Change plan settings (recommend do this for all options) > Change advanced power settings > Processor power management > minimum processor rate. Change all values to 0 or 1 %.4) Restart your PC.5) Go to Gigabyte Control Center again. Using the lowest CPU slider option and on Quite Mode in Device Setting, the laptop should run ~40-45 *C on idle, and fans should not be running when using typical web browsing/Office apps.When under load (playing games, video editing, etc.) changes above should not have noticeable effects on performance. It's a pity that the laptop doesn't come with these settings automatically, but this is the work you have to do if your unit has problems like mine. If these changes does not work, considering returning your laptop. Again, I only have this laptop for a few days. Take these advises with a grain of salt.",true,1,16,"115","B07SHJXNBL","laptop gigabyte aero",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,78,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SHJXNBL","288.60",false,false,false,false,"Gigabyte AERO 15 OLED SA-7US5020SH 15"" Thin Bezel Samsung UHD Amoled, i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, Samsung 8GB RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eTChBKn5L._AC_UY218_.jpg"
"R2MB0QYIC1C4K1","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2020",2,"Not for casuals. Seriously.","If I weren't technically inclined I would be utterly heartbroken over this purchase. If all you do is edit photos and tinker around on the internet - it's fine but this laptop is marketed to power users. If you game in any capacity, do a lot of video rendering or anything that comes close to maxing cpu loads then you will absolutely thermal throttle 100% of the time. This laptop requires use of Throttlestop and the know-how to set it up. You cannot use intel XTU. After setting it to max out at 3.8-3.9 Ghz and setting a -150mv undervolt it now barely ever breaks mid 70 degrees Celsius. Before it would it 90 degree before a games splash screen was loaded. It was that bad. 4.0ghz seems to be the tipping point before heat skyrockets.Next, a few weeks ago the gpu fan started making crunching sounds and then go silent. I opened the monitoring utility and saw that when it went silent that it was actually turning off. The fan was trying to start and puttering out. I had to disassemble everything to get to the fans and take it apart to oil it after 2 months of ownership! The entire inside was spotless but it seems that bad fans are pretty common and other people have had to send their computers away. NOPE! Not this guy. Cost me 7 bucks because I had to repaste the CPU and GPU over a freaking bad fan - thank god the motor still had power. I just thought the cute little guy liked to chirp at me from time to time. Didn't know it was a time bomb.Next, RAM. Just buy Samsung. Don't do anything else. Other motherboards will let you mix brands - hell even frequencies. This one is a picky eater.So with that being said, where else are you going to get a laptop this BEAUTIFUL and UNIQUE? This product once the bugs are sorted is an absolute joy. The GPU now easily overclocks 100mhz (MSI Afterburner) and runs neck in neck with the desktop version with (now) great thermals and frames. I can now take it anywhere without worrying about it self-destructing.However, the fact that if I were a common consumer I probably would be without a computer and living in warranty nightmare I cannot recommend this to anyone aside from techy nerds. If at any point you did not understand my jargon - back off. If you did and are not intimidated - enter at your own risk and use my experience to guide you.",true,1,16,"115","B07SHJXNBL","laptop gigabyte aero",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,78,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SHJXNBL","288.60",false,false,false,false,"Gigabyte AERO 15 OLED SA-7US5020SH 15"" Thin Bezel Samsung UHD Amoled, i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, Samsung 8GB RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eTChBKn5L._AC_UY218_.jpg"
