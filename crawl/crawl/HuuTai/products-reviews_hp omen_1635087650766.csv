"R2K3H97LQ3T8B9","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021",4,"Powerful PC that will accomplish any task","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I was a bit worried when I ordered this PC because it shipped from Delaware and I live in California. After 4-5 days, it made its journey safety across the United States with no issues thankfully. The PC is packed into precut high quality foam, wrapped in plastic, inside a thick cardboard box. I have not used tech support yet so no comment on that.I have only had the pc a week and a half, but so far so good. PC comes preinstalled with windows 10 and some bloat ware such as Microsoft one drive, Mc Afee, and a few other programs. Omen gaming hub is nice software that you can use to customize the lights on your pc, overlock your processor, and to watch your temps. Reading a lot of reviews beforehand I know this pc can run really hot, and that was my main concern. I installed cyberpunk 2077 and ran it on ultra setting with ray tracing. It looks beautiful but the pc did get quite loud. It also got pretty hot too. My CPU bounced around 88-91 C, where this processors max temp is 100 C before it shuts off. After turning Vsync on and ray tracing off, the temps and loudness dropped significantly. CPU sits in the 70s C and GPU sits in the 60s C.I live streamed all weekend a couple games: world of Warcraft and cyberpunk 2077. The processor can easily handle high end gaming and streaming at the same time, as long as you are reasonable with the settings. If you’re playing cyberpunk 2077 on ultra ray tracing while streaming, your computer will get very hot and loud. If you cap vsync at 60 or 90 frames, you shouldn’t have an issue with high heat or noise. Remember, this processor and graphics card are powerful hardware, they will get hot! The case and fans does it’s job though if you’re playing games on medium settings. I keep my fans on turbo and Vsync on and don’t have any issues with overheating or loudness. I haven’t overclocked my PC yet. Like any powerful gaming rig, this PC is a space heater! It will need to sit on a desk or in the open air. Your room will get warm. It feels nice right now during these cold nights but I can’t imagine this PC in the summer with no a/c.You will be pleased at how this PC performs. You will have to find the right settings for you to keep the temps and loudness at bay when running demanding games, but that’s to be expected with such powerful hardware in a snug case. Older games like WoW you don’t need Vsync. I get 300-400 fps on max settings.",true,1,1,"11","B08HR91FHT","hp omen",false,2999.95,"USD",0,0,0,878,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HR91FHT","3775.40",false,false,false,false,"OMEN 30L Gaming Desktop PC, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Card, 10th Generation Intel Core i9-10900K Processor, 32 GB R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yGv35VljL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R164G2WJILL5VT","Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2021",5,"the temperature problem","I purchased this Omen 30L (HP Model# GT13-0092) over a month ago. I have no complaints besides how expensive PC gaming is... lolGPU = RTX 3080CPU = Intel Core i9-10850K.32 GB RamI want to address the number 1 complaint I found while researching this PC, the temperatures. The temperatures and fan noise but it's all related. Yes, it is a problem. Things get too hot (80C+) and the fans kick on the high setting during gaming. It was a common thing before I looked into fixing it.The temperature problem is with the CPU. That's the liquid cooled part and it is liquid cooled because CPUs run hot in general. You should first make sure those lines are not kinked. I read about that being a thing for some people.The next thing you should do to fix the temperatures is to reduce the maximum power the CPU uses. You can find it in the advanced power settings for the computer. There is a section where you can select the minimum and maximum power states of the CPU. Instead of 100%, max the CPU at a few percent less. I can tell you from experience that 95% works great but you may be able to get away with 98% (I'm currently testing this).This has proven to be a great fix for the temperature problem in my experience with it. I'm not even concerned about it anymore. This Omen PC is limited by the GPU and not the CPU so running the CPU at 95-98% doesn't affect performance. Even with my CPU at 95%, games tell me that the GPU is my bottleneck.About the noise of the fans. I think it's a little ridiculous that people complain so strongly about it. I don't think the fans are overly loud. Definitely perfectly quiet when they are running normally and with the fix I mentioned it's basically always that way. But with that said, I heard a youtuber complaining about how loud hard drives are when they click while loading. If you are someone bothered by hard drives clicking then yes, the fans are too loud for you as well.

I'd like to sneak it into the office, but I will have to explain that logo, which I cant even explain now. Its also ugly.Ok, now the (very) good...This version has more features than I expected. The bios and mainboard not only supports undervolting, (earlier versions of the 17"" omens did not) but they've even designed a feature where the user can select either 'Optimize' the undervoltage setting by automatically finding that sweet spot, or 'Custom' where you can set it yourself. The screen is bright and has great color and contrast. The mousepad feels nice and responsive. The fans aren't too noisy, its about the volume I expected when running full speed. Now, about 'sneaking it into the office'; if your worried about fan noise, there's an app that comes with the Nvidia GPU that you can access and set it to 'Whisper mode', and what that will do is it will cap the framerate to whatever you want,the lowest being 30 FPS, which is aboutstandard blu-ray or DVD movie framerate anyway, and that will help keep the fans from spooling up.Two reasons I picked the 17"" is because I wanted a bigger screen, but also wanted a laptop that can dissipate heat, and I feel many of those thin designs might have difficulty there. There were some concerns about the hinge design and positions and screen torsional flex, but now that I can see them for myself, I am unconcerned and I would say they are fine. They are pretty firm, and there is some screen flexing, but just a littlemore than the other laptops I own.The final deciding factor is that I've had good experience with HPs. The last two companies I worked for used HP exclusively for their laptops, and I own a 17"" HP Envy which was a beast when I got it 7 years ago, its still my go-to business laptop to this day with zero issues.I believe the Omen 17"" laptop will give you the best bang for your hard earned buck.I just hate that logo, whatever its supposed to be.",true,1,7,"17","B087Z21FXV","hp omen",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,127,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z21FXV","571.50",false,false,false,false,"OMEN 17 Gaming Laptop, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070, Intel Core i7-10750H, 16 GB DDR4 RAM, 512 GB PCIe NVMe SSD, 17.3"" 144Hz Fu...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nMnhr0iiS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R28PG998HZV73","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2021",4,"Good laptop, but buyer be wary of sellers shipping modified lower-spec models","I bought the HP Omen 15 15-EN-0023DX last year and it's been a great laptop so far. Gaming performance is on par with what I expect out of the GTX 1660 Ti, and the Ryzen 7 4800H is just fantastic. The laptop became my daily driver for most uses, as it outperforms my overclocked Core i7-8086k desktop in everything but gaming.Multi-monitor support is not the greatest: I have 2 4k external monitors, and I have to drive 1 off of DisplayPort and one off of DisplayLink over USB. I could not get DP MST working over the DisplayPort, even though it should be capable of 2x 4k60. I could get them both working via DisplayLink, but DisplayLink has issues with some software (mostly games) so it wasn't viable for me.Major shortcomings of the Omen 15 are a lack of Thunderbolt support (not really surprising since TB is Intel, but nothing prevents HP from putting a TB controller in an AMD laptop), and no support for USB PD. The former is somewhat excusable, but the latter is baffling. Sure, you can deliver more power via the power brick, but outside of gaming, you're never going to exceed the power limits of USB PD. Thunderbolt + USB PD gives single-cable convenience: just plug your laptop into a docking station and you're done. Instead, I have a mess of cables to deal with every time I want to take the laptop with me.In regards to the ""buyer be wary"" bit: I purchased the 15-EN-0023DX, but actually received a 15-EN-0013DX (normally 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD), that the seller had upgraded to match the specs of the 15-EN-0023DX. This went undetected until I sent the laptop in for warranty service with HP, who declined to repair the laptop, since it had 3rd party components in it. I have contacted the seller to address this (no response yet), but the seller should never haver voided the warranty in the first place. Check your serial number with HP to confirm that you indeed have the model you ordered, or you might run into the same problem.",true,1,10,"110","B08G3T3G9X","hp omen",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,93,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G3T3G9X","409.20",false,false,false,false,"HP OMEN | 15-EN0023DX/Gaming 15.6"" Laptop | AMD Ryzen 7/4800H | 16GB DDR4 3200/MHz | 1TB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD | NVIDIA GeForc...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91QgWSxmriL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2L5LINLH80ESR","Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2021",5,"Bang for your buck should be name for this thing.","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Although I was very wary to make this purchase due to the lack of in-depth photos from OMEN, (like c'mon guys...really?) I got to say I was pleasantly surprised. With a simple sleek design, the omen 30L looks very nice sitting on my desk and has built-in software for the RGB that is actually was a very nice and customizable to set up which is great! **HOWEVER** the cable management is sloppy, to say the least. Packaging was solid and there was no cosmetic or internal damage. And, Omen was nice enough to send the saddest mouse and keyboard I ever did see, but I can respect it for someone who doesn't already have one. (Disclaimer) if your using HDMI to plug into your tv, this rig does not come with a cable in the package!! (it only comes with a power cable) Luckily I already had one on hand.. This surprisingly has a good amount of ports on front and back and accommodated everything I had to plug-in.Starting up was a breeze, the instructions were clear and you will be up and running in less than 15 minutes. For what you pay for you get a pretty powerful machine. Booting up apps and games is not a 5-minute wait. Logging into games usually takes anywhere from a minute to a minute and a half. The geforce rtx 3060 is great and knowing that they are almost impossible to get right now, shows its a steal to get it in this rig. This has no problem running shaders on Minecraft such as BSL, and SEUS at 60 fps in 1080 averaging about 40 degrees celsius for the CPU.Also (Geforce has a built in software that makes checking how your internals are running (fps, cpu temp, ect.) at the touch of a button. Literally alt+z. It is very intuitive and a great add-on. For noise, the fans stay silent but sometimes rise to a dull hum even after running for 8 hours plus, but it really is pretty silent for the most part. For the money and the way pc parts are slim at the moment, I would say this is a pretty good buy. And i never leave reviews but on amazon there are no reviews (another reason I was wary on buying) so I felt I should let the people know whats up. For an average gamer, this thing is a steal and more than enough to handle most games. Im pretty happy with it, although like most reviews, they say the airflow in the case is less than satisfactory, and it is i guess. It hasn't given me any real problems yet, but the top of the case is a grate which should let air through because heat rises right? Wrong, there is another mount for another fan right on the inside of the pc at the very top, blocking airflow, and its has no holes to let air through. SO if you have money left over, you can buy a new case with better air flow or a new fan to mount there.

I only keep ONE file on my OneDrive, but it will try to save everything on there if you don’t turn it off or uninstall it at your initial startup.

It stays relatively cool and the fans don't get too loud under it's lower power options when not being pushed to do demanding task. Under a heavy load though it can get quite loud as expected(jet engines).As for the battery. It is good when compared to other gaming laptops with the same specs but I wish it were better and able to last the day doing regular task but unfortunately you'll only be able to squeeze around 6 hrs out with continuous use. This is a minor inconvenience to me personally.Lastly, when it comes to this computers design, the keyboard has an excellent feel , the hinges work great and have a good level of resistance preventing any screen wobble. The two biggest problems for me also had to do with design. The sharp edges around the laptop are annoying, while it won't cut you it is noticeably uncomfortable against the wrist while typing. My absolute biggest complaint though, the laptop is not level for some reason, it wobbles when put on flat surfaces and the base appears to be curved (this could just be my model but it annoys the hell out of me).Overall this is a great gaming laptop and one of the best you can get today at it's price point.",true,1,14,"114","B08JVNZJWT","hp omen",true,1324.99,"USD",1449,124.01,8.56,50,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JVNZJWT","235.00",false,true,false,false,"HP - OMEN Gaming 15.6"" Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti - 512GB SSD - Mica Silver","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91QgWSxmriL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

For my purposes, this laptop works great! I also occasionally play some light games and this laptop has no problems at all. Not sure how well it does with the latest and the greatest though.Overall I'm pretty happy with it, but there is one problem which may annoy some people. Whenever this laptop is on, it emits high pitch audible noise. I initially thought it was the fan noise, but it's present even when the fans are not spinning and sounds like the noise is coming from some power components on the motherboard. I got used to it and don't mind, but I do know a few people who can't take this type of high frequency noise. If you are one of them, please beware!Update: Apr 6, 2021Just after posting my original review, an update was pushed which significantly reduced the high pitch noise coming out of this laptop.
