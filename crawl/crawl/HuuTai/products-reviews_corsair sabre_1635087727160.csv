"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,1,"10","B07QX9C9WH","corsair sabre",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R3L8O60668R76I","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2021",5,"A nearly perfect mouse SO FAR.","Mice are something that seem to last about a year. Going into a review, you should not really expect much more than that these days if you are a hardcore user. Bearing that in mind, there are still some huge quality differences between something like this and Corsair's Harpoon.I had a Harpoon, the cheaper version of this mouse, for about a year. It did an okay job. It has less options through iCUE, and in general it's just a lesser mouse in every way. The second Harpoon I had came broken in both wheel and Omron switches, so I decided to go back to a Sabre, which I previously abandoned due to it not lasting more than 1.5 years before.Well, I guess I am here to stay, because despite Corsair manufacturing mice to basically die in a year or two, this is so much better than a Harpoon. It has dual DPI axis settings, tons of lighting settings that the other doesn't have including more options for when you are not using iCUE, and of course it can poll up into the 8000Hz range along with much improved ergonomics.Previously, you had to manually kill the iCUE process, instead of exiting normally, to retain lighting, such as no lighting, if you didn't want the iCUE process running at all. You could not exit out of it normally, or your lighting would go right back to brightly lit rainbow default. This is fixed with their ""hardware lighting"" option, except for the three DPI markers, which you still need to kill the process to get back to your normal settings.They really need to include the DPI settings in the hardware lighting option, because some of us do not want Corsair processes running at all, and we want a no lit mouse but with the option at least of having it lit when needed. Of course you can bypass all of this and just get the unlit version I think. But they still need to make a way for the DPI lights to shut off without iCUE on, and without having to use the workaround, which does work fine anyway.From a comfort standpoint, it's also a cut above. In fact, this is probably the most comfortable mouse I have ever used. Everything seems almost perfectly suited to my hands and movements. The mouse itself is quite light but not so that you would get annoyed. It glides extremely well, and there is a calibration setting for glide sensitivity built into iCUE for their better mice. It works, and this is the first time I feel not annoyed by iCUE in ages. It has come a long way, and this mouse makes full use of it.So in reality they have made steps forward in nearly every category here. iCUE is no longer garbage, the mouse functions extremely well, and it is a massive cut above their cheaper options.That about sums it up honestly. Much improved in just about every way. The click area is the same hard plastic with coating that will probably wear away after a year or two of solid use. So keep that in mind as well. These don't last forever.

"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,11,"110","B07QX9C9WH","corsair sabre",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The sniper button is INCREDIBLY useful. I though of it more as a gimmick at first but no it makes such a huge difference in the fine aiming for high zoom weapons or vehicles.As far as ergonomics I have fairly large hands and it fits great. The thumb rest keeps your hand on the mouse and off the pad to make for smooth movement and less drag and the ability to change the weight is more valuable than I first assumed.I picked this up on sale and I think the price point is very fair for what you are getting.

I'm not sure why gaming mouses don't have right side buttons. So basically I got this mouse for the buttons.I play 3 different action MMORPGs with action combat, using mouse clicks for skills.The left side buttons are so faulty and trash. There's friction between my finger and the mouse skills popping off when I click.This mouse was not designed for gaming... The left side buttons are too far forward and flimsy. It does not feel like I'm pressing a button, more like reaching for something unsecured and difficult to push.The clickers need to pressed rather than lightly touched. I find this to be harder to deal with ... Think about slamming your hand flat on a table, this is what it feels like to press the clickers.Something more annoying than the buttons is the failure to load. Sharkoon always loads, crosair does not.I have had to restart computer, unplug and replug, even loaded the ique software. Why? Because the mouse DOES NOT COME ON.. A few times it shut off completely. Unable to scroll and lost cursor...Do you know how ANNOYING this is?I like to have a mouse with right side buttons... But honestly my old sharkoon is waaay better!",true,1,16,"115","B07QZHSTLC","corsair sabre",true,28.49,"USD",39.99,11.5,28.76,1314,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QZHSTLC","6044.40",false,false,false,false,"Corsair M55 RGB Pro Wired Ambidextrous Multi-Grip Gaming Mouse - 12,400 DPI Adjustable Sensor - 8 Programmable Buttons - B...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p5oKUUSdL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
