"R1KKRQ56AUF8UZ","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",5,"Excellent value for money, and great for productivity","I has used a Logitech solar powered keyboard for almost 4 years and fancied a change. I had seen so many reviews of mechanical keyboards. I was intrigued by the idea of switches that trigger in a linear way, sit higher up than the low laptop like solar powered keyboard, but not be full height and travel like a regular ""gaming"" keyboard. And this K60 LP is the perfect middle ground. Love the RGB, subtle but useful. I like the full layout as I use the num pad for work. Solid aluminium chassis.

Since I tried this, following their instructions step-by-step, my keyboard no longer works at all. No lights, no response, nothing. I tried different USB ports, reset my computer, tried a different computer, nothing. I can get it back to the ""DRP_Disabled"" drive but that's it.Not happy.

"R1FRW9RUUQ0DB1","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",2,"Great initially, but not built to last","I bought this keyboard in November of 2018. I am a casual gamer, and I really enjoyed the bright colors and the Cherry MX Speed keys. I have never had a keyboard with dedicated macro keys before, and the keyboard itself seemed quite sturdy.Fast-forward to today, and I am having some annoying difficulties with this keyboard that others have noted in the reviews. It does not happen every time, but often when I try to type an ""A"" it ends up writing ""AA"" or ""AAA"". It does not happen every time I press the button either, which only makes it more annoying. As another reviewer noted, this seems to be due to using WASD keys more than the others.In addition, I find that the spacebar is difficult to use in some games. Unless I perfectly hit it in the middle on every press, it will over time begin to slope downward to the left (when my left hand is on WASD my thumb naturally falls just left of the center of the spacebar). This eventually results in the spacebar not registering all of my presses until I press down on the right side and get it back to level.Lastly, switching between users on my computer often causes the keyboard software to glitch and refuse to work until I unplug the USB and plug it back in.None of these issues seem like major concerns, but I bought this keyboard thinking that it would last longer than 3 years.

My major problem with this keyboard is the keys start to break.The plastic that makes up the cross pattern that connects the key to the keyboard seems to be very weak. Within about 2 months or so of owning it, the left side control key broke. To Corsairs credit they sent me a replacement key very quickly, but a few months after that the right control key started to come loose.What I have noticed is it is the keys that are around the edge of the keyboard that have the issue. What I believe it to be is it is the keys that you aren’t pressing at a straight up and down, it is the keys that you are reaching over to with your pinky fingers that are really the problem. I have a feeling overtime they would all start to break down, but the ones that are getting more pressure at an angle are just breaking first.Long story short, I replacing this and going back to my trusted Logitech keyboard because, while their customer service was great, I can’t be waiting for replacement keys every couple months.If this is primarily used for gaming and not a combination of day-to-day and gaming I would say it will last you a while, but if you’re thinking about getting this for your day-to-day I wouldn’t recommend it.",true,1,6,"15","B01MS0I1ZK","corsair k68",false,198.99,"USD",0,0,0,5028,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MS0I1ZK","23128.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard -6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Tac...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71niQiKL9lL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I've never created any before this and use the Icue system it was realitivly easy to figure out but there was a slight learning curve through guess and check but got everything working the way i wanted. Lightning is great and customizable. easy to switch it up or just cut it off.Now for the errors. seems to be few. Had to uninstall and reinstall the icue system because it got corrupted two times during my use somehow. Had a few issues reinstalling and getting everything working the 2nd time.The biggest annoyance (at least its something small) is the volume buttons on top right to mute, lower or raise the volume will just stop working. ill restart icue but that wont work. The only way to fix this is either A: restarting the computer sometimes fixes it. B: Go to settings in Icue and force update the firmware. even though you are currently on that firmware you have to force update it so it starts working again. While this is a rather simple fix. I've had this issue for over a year and it still hasn't been fixed but is a known issue (i found it by googling forums)",true,1,6,"15","B01MS0I1ZK","corsair k68",false,198.99,"USD",0,0,0,5028,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MS0I1ZK","23128.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard -6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Tac...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71niQiKL9lL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

There are so many better options for your keyboard!","This BEST part of Corsair's newest generation of keyboards is they now use a standard bottom row. This means that you can put almost any keycap set you want on your fancy new keyboard and really make it your own one of a kind keyboard. You are no longer beholden to Corsair's proprietary first party keycap sets. Which is a good thing because these Corsair key caps kind of suck.I've posted some pictures of my K65 keyboard to show what I mean. You can see that the light bleed on these keycaps is just terrible. The red keys in the picture are corsair and the white and blue keycaps are from a third party (drop, I think). On the red switches the entire area around the lettering glows meaning that they are thin in that area. The white switches the only theletter lights up more without the bleed. This is especially true with higher brightness levels and colors closer to white. On the red keycaps when the RGB is set to pure white the color comes through as a deeper pink. The same could be said of the blue third party caps, but it's not nearly as bad.On the upside these keycaps feel good and will fit just about any keyboard, but you can spend the same money and get a much better keycap from places like Drop, Ducky, HyperX or just about anywhere else.Do yourself a favor- look elsewhere.",true,1,12,"111","B0919KTK2B","corsair k68",false,29.99,"USD",0,0,0,926,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0919KTK2B","4259.60",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR PBT Double-Shot PRO Keycap Mod Kit – Double-Shot PBT Keycaps – Onyx Black – Standard Bottom Row – Textured Surface...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ex2gQlCbS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Just resting my fingers on the keys will cause unintended activations - which caused me endless typos when typing and problems in games, doing things I had no intention to do.This may be different for you, as I am used to Logitech keyboards with tactile keys and low travel, where you have to push the key past the tactile ""hump"" before you get any activation.So if you are used to non-tactile cherry switches, you can disregard that part of my review.It was surprising to me, to have keys with quite more travel than I'm used to, but that would activate at the very top position.I assume some gamers want just that, so they have faster activations.For me, that was catastrophic and I returned this and ordered another Logitech keyboard - also designed for gaming, but with tactile + clicky keys.I would have gone for just tactile, but those were sold out... ah well:)Hopefully this helps someone who might otherwise end up with the wrong keyboard...Note, that low profile switches that are also tactile seem to be unavailable from Cherry!I give 4 stars, because keys are a personal choice and what doesn't work for me might work for you.",true,1,17,"116","B07H6LBQ62","corsair k68",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,676,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6LBQ62","3177.20",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR K70 RGB MK.2 RAPIDFIRE Low Profile - Backlit RGB LED - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Fastest & Linear Low Pro...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716-o5oFSjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R16PULKI4RZGT0","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2021",5,"Finally, a low-profile mechanical!","I haven't tried many mechanical keyboard before this one, but they always felt too tall and chunky to me. I grew too accustomed to laptop keyboards in the mid 2000's, and then had a low-profile membrane gaming keyboard (Microsoft Sidewinder) for many years, and like that form factor. When I saw that Corsair, a brand I trust and whose mice I already adore, made a low profile mechanical board, I wanted to try it out. And it didn't disappoint! Love the mechanical feel, which is more stable and linear than the slightly wobbly keys of my old membrane board, without feeling uncomfortably tall like most standard mechanical boards feel to me.All the other features are awesome, too. The iCue software makes customizing the RGB super fun. You can program each key individually with dozens of patterns, in literally any color you can imagine. Corsair really has the best RGB ecosystem. On top of that, the USB passthrough is handy, and the media controls are super convenient. Also, the profile switch button makes it easy to change lighting on the fly, and since my computer lives near my bed, makes it easy to put my whole computer in ""stealth mode"" by switching to a profile that turns all the RGB off so it doesn't keep me up at night while my gaming rig passively mines crypto to help recoup the cost of building it.All in all, a solid 9.5/10.

"R2PC0IIPIZJ45C","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021",1,"Great Keyboard, Poor Lighting Quality","Update: I haven't even had the replacement keyboard a week and the escape key just flat out doesn't work. Do not buy this keyboard, it is pure junk.I really like the way this keyboard feels to type on. The low profile keys are nice, the switches are pretty quiet overall, and it feels very responsive. From a day to day use standpoint, I have absolutely zero complaints about this product. However, one of the reasons to buy a keyboard like this one is the lightning and that's where my issues begin.First, I am very, very lucky if iCUE, Corsair's peripheral management software, recognizes this keyboard, which means it's almost always either on the default rainbow state or stuck on one color (I have it set to rotate between three colors normally to match the lighting on my tower), plus I can't manage any of the keys or use custom keybinds. Often iCUE will even see the keyboard is connected but still won't let me manage it. This is remedied if I unplug it and plug it back in several times; basically, it will eventually always recognize it, but it's a question of how long I have to fidget with it and then a roll of the dice on how long it'll stay connected.Second, when it actually IS working with iCUE, typing on it causes the keys to randomly flash white on keystroke, which is definitely not a thing it should be doing. It's very distracting when every third or fourth keystroke causes the whole keyboard to be briefly bright white. This only happens when the keyboard's iCUE profile is actually working, though, so basically I am stuck with a situation where if the software doesn't see it, it doesn't work right, and if the software sees it, it doesn't work right in a completely different way.I sent the first of these back assuming it was a defect and the second one has all the exact same problems, so my suggestion would be to look elsewhere; I am sure you can get cheaper keyboards with similar keys and skip the lighting problems.",true,1,19,"118","B07H6MWLXS","corsair k68",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,457,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6MWLXS","2147.90",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 Low Profile Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - Linear & Quiet, Backlit RGB LED, Cherry MX Low Profile Red","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zMyzhd6WL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
