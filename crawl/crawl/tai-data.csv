"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,1,"11","B07QX9C9WH","corsair darkcore",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,true,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R17S99462UVJM3","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2021",1,"Pretty painful for beginners","Edit: still dealing with customer service via snail mail basically, one response a day and I’m pretty sure it’s different people because I get asked the same questions. Going to likely and painfully return this horrible product especially after hearing this happen to others.Edit: this product is the most frustrating experience, nothing lights up properly and customer service told me I had to play email tag because their “tech support” doesn’t cover troubleshooting this and the people that do only answer by email. Sometimes 2 fans light up, other times just one but never all 3 and nothing else in the kit has ever lit up as intended. Stay away.This product comes in great packaging and you really feel like you got value for money especially when you tally up the individual items.It’s also not the cheapest, but I wanted to get something higher quality being my first time and all, but this wasn’t quite the case.To begin I learned the pipes were called something that’s just a fancy word for acrylic, and I learned very fast that it’s not very forgiving and easy to mess up. Couple that with the types of adapters you get which pretty much commit you to hardline tubing and you are stuck either with attempting to use them (and in my case immediately messing up a tube despite watching videos prior,) or investing a lot more money to get better tubes or different adapters, but it doesn’t end there…It comes with a squeeze container for filling the pump which broke off inside just from using, that was 2 hours of draining and playing rubik’s cube trying to get out, not fun. But it doesn’t end there either…The pump is awkward as heck, if you have it all plugged in the thing doesn’t operate at full power when filling and you are stuck trying to figure out why the tubes aren’t filling, why does it gotta be like that?The directions aren’t the best, and this process was very painful, I got coolant all over my motherboard and cards despite my best intent to cover everything which yes, is part to user error but I also feel the acrylic isn’t the best use and I wish there were more options from Corsair like being able to buy a kit with soft tubing.

"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better.

"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

I figured I was just unlucky and grabbed another because I really like the design of the mouse and how it feels in my hand. However, I am already having issues with this mouse giving the double click issue as well, this time with the right mouse button. I've had this one for even less time than the previous. For something that costs 80 dollars this really isn't acceptable and I will be switching to a different brand for my next one.Also, iCue is the worst software package I have ever used, and is basically required to get any sort of functionality out of the mmo buttons on the side.The Logitech mmo mouse (G600) while not looking nearly as attractive lasted me for about 5 years before I finally gave it to a friend after picking up my first Scimitar. He's still using that mouse. It also comes in at half the price and has a ""better"" software setup. Not that Logi's is amazing either, but it's far better than iCue.

None have fit my hold style like this does, and its manly due to the pinky rest attachment which makes it fantastic to grip.The software is decent, takes a bit of time to upload changes to the mouse but not a big deal since its unlikely to constantly change those settings once set to ones liking.I was worried the weight wouldn't be to my liking (I prefer the lightest mice) but it really doesn't feel as heavy as it sounds.Excellent on either desk top or on a mouse pad, I find it rare when a mouse has feet that feel nice without a mouse pad.The negatives are:-Barrel scroll wheel is bit difficult to reach but this may just be due to my strange hold style.-Main scroll wheel sometimes doesnt register a scroll, this is also an issue on razer and logitech mice I've used (why do high end mice seem to have scroll wheels that cant detect correctly on each scroll?).",true,1,16,"116","B07P5VCGF4","corsair darkcore",true,65.26,"USD",72.99,7.73,10.59,1056,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5VCGF4","4646.40",false,false,false,false,"Mad Catz The Authentic R.A.T.

"R39KG38763SPB3","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",2,"Underwhelming","I purchased the 8+ White. At the time of purchase, it was a little under $90 USD. TL;DR: sub-par build quality, poor ergonomics, and weird design decisions.Let's start with the good:I'm a sucker for weird computer peripherals, and this definitely delivers in that regard. The customization is nice -- being able to swap out palm rests, adjusting the angle of the thumb rest, or modifying the weight is cool. There's a lot that can be done to make it fit your hand, and I respect that.I found the software to be adequate as well. Windows only for the software, though any edits you make are saved to the mouse directly so it'll work on Linux or Mac. (But keep in mind for Mac, there aren't any bindings in the software for CMD, if you have any intention of using this for complex Mac-specific macros. This doesn't affect my score since this is advertised as Windows-only, which is fair.)It's easy-ish to open up. Just threes screws and a bit of finesse. Repairability seems feasible.Unfortunately, there isn't much else I can say about it that's good besides it's a functioning mouse.Here are a handful of my issues with the device:- Poor build quality.One of the first things I noticed after opening and inspecting the mouse was that one of the plastic top panels was loose. It's not that it was screwed in wrong or anything (I opened the mouse up to check), but rather that the plastic just wasn't molded to properly fit. It's not a huge deal, but there's a noticeable gap about the size of my fingernail that sits between the top panel with the ""RAT 8+"" logo and the black frame underneath.Basically every button on the mouse has some crazy wobble to it, especially the right mouse button and middle DPI switch on mine. I shimmed some of the empty space with small bits of paper to reduce the wobble, which worked. Although if you want to do this for the DPI switch, you'll have to open up the mouse.Another gripe: Out of the box, I couldn't get the adjustment tool to work on any of the thumb rest adjustments. They were super tight, to the point of where I needed a screwdriver to loosen them. Maybe just an issue on my unit, but keep in mind it might be helpful to have a small hex allen wrench on hand.- Bad ergonomics.I understand this is subjective, so I'm not factoring this too heavily into my score. But despite all the customizability, my hand always had a tendency to feel sore after using it for long periods of time, no matter how many configurations I tried. It's probably okay for shorter gaming sessions, but if you're also using this for productivity, you might have comfort issues. My hands are slim and maybe small-medium in size, for reference.- Weird design decisions.On the thumb rest, there's a screw hole right behind the sniper button where your thumb will likely naturally rest. At first thought, no issue. But after only like a month of using this mouse, everything around that screw hole is covered in grime. I wash my hands just as much as the next guy, so bear in mind this area might need some extra attention when cleaning.Another weird one is the pinky rest attachment, which I wanted to love. Unfortunately, it has an issue where it didn't actually make physical contact with the desk, instead hovering like 2mm above it. Sounds reasonable: less contact, less friction when gaming, right? Well -- with the size and weight of the pinky rest, the reality of the situation is that even the slightest bit of unbalanced pressure from your hand means your mouse is now lopsided and leaning to the right. It's super easy to run into this unintentionally, and it makes the whole thing just feel poorly thought out and engineered. A quick fix: find an old mouse you're not using, peel off one of the smaller skates from the bottom, and then stick that onto the pinky rest's skate. That should close the gap and reduce the tendency to tilt to the right. It'll introduce more drag, but you're probably not going to be using the pinky rest for gaming anyways because of how huge it is.Finally, I want to mention the weight of this mouse. It's heavy. I don't know the exact numbers, but I was only able to get this to a comfortable weight by removing all of the included weights, as well as the spring + adjustment tool under the palm rest. If you want a light mouse for gaming, this isn't it.Other thoughts, that don't reflect my rating:- I really don't know what to use the horizontal scroll wheel for. I mean, sure, horizontal scrolling -- but I do that so rarely it feels overkill to have a separate wheel dedicated to it. I used the software to bind page up/down to the wheel to try it out as a super-fast scrolling solution, like some knock-off Logitech frictionless scroll. It was adequate. Maybe other people will find more use for it than me.- This mouse loves its decals. It's a bit of a detractor for me. I honestly think this thing would look a lot nicer with maybe just a single Mad Catz logo somewhere. The palm rests are extra weird, they have this "" 0 -- 5 -- 10 -- 15 -- 20"" ruler-like thing printed on but it's totally non-functional and looks weird. It'd look better blank.- My cursor had a tendency to ""jump"" around sometimes. I think the sensor might have been calibrated weirdly. There's an option to do this in the software. Not sure if mine was defective, but it didn't bother me enough to try to recalibrate it while I was using the mouse. Seemed to only happen just after the mouse was lifted + set back down.- I'm no longer using this mouse. I managed to replace the broken scroll encoder on my Swiftpoint Z, and I'm going back to that as my daily driver.",true,1,16,"116","B07P5VCGF4","corsair darkcore",true,65.26,"USD",72.99,7.73,10.59,1056,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5VCGF4","4646.40",false,false,false,false,"Mad Catz The Authentic R.A.T.

"R26NDXW4MB313","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2021",5,"A Good Mouse, Surprisingly Works Well","I didn't expect much from this mouse being wireless and all, but it surprised me.The most important thing here is that it feels very similar to my older RAT8, same shape, same size, only unlike the RAT8 which comes with some weird silicon coating or a gloss coating, the DWS comes with a nice matte plastic that feels really nice -- some say it feels like cheap plastic, it really does not. Really good feel. And it looks really nice in person too, love the Silver & Black. The other difference is the side trigger, better placement and a larger button and bit more flat so it feels much more comfortable reaching your thumb over to press.The Wireless options are good. Bluetooth and 2.4G connections are good. It seems the 2.4G connection is much smoother however, sometimes the Bluetooth connection will stutter after turning it off and back on. So far I haven't experienced any significant lag or issues with 2.4G as I historically did with older tech, but it's not 100% perfect as I do see a hiccup here or there. Nothing I'd really call a deal breaker.I run on a 144Hz gaming monitor and the mouse movements are smoother than other wireless mice, but not as smooth as my wired RAT8. I would say the smooth mouse movements on the DWS are about 85% of my wired RAT8, which means for gaming I would notice a slight drop in smoothness, but honestly, unless you're staring at the mouse cursor directly as you move it left and right real fast, it isn't very noticeable.The clicking feels good, but a bit more stiff than the RAT8 (likely because it's new). The only thing I don't like is how the mouse feels when scrolling down, it's has much harder rolling-ticks down than scrolling up, and sometimes it feels like it's missing some of these scrolls, so when browsing web pages, it'll scroll, stall for half a second and scroll again. I wonder if this one mouse is somewhat messed up with this one issue -- then again my RAT8 will also do this from time to time — but not as much.Overall I really like this mouse.

"R2I3U1V0GD0E","Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2021",2,"HEAR ME OUT FIRST","I purchased this product (March 14,2020) at the start of the Corona Pandemic. (Take note of this)I have medium size hands and its the most comfortable mouse up to date, there is a discomfort feeling at the bottom of my thumb where the mouse has a small ""hedge"" after 7+ hours of using the mouse. Apart from everything else I love the mouse from the button location and length to the infinite spinning wheel or manual wheel even to the customization of the color and DPI.Now you're thinking, why would this product have 2 stars? Well simply put, I have pets and one of my munchkins is known for biting wires, so it would be logical to invest in a Bluetooth mouse for this and apart from gaming as well. The problem I have with this mouse is that the Bluetooth is completely miss for me! I cannot say the same for others. Now I figured it may have been a lemon or so and I contacted support through Logitech on JULY of 2020, and from all the steps I've taken to ensure it was a lemon product, I received a confirmation that I would have a replacement, due to Corona I did not receive an email from them when they would eventually be in stock. Fast forward to Late January of 2021 I decided that my mouse needed to be replaced ASAP. I NEED my Bluetooth connectivity so I had a chat with the same representative from the start and I wanted to compromise with something of the same value or greater, which I was more than happy to pay and they decided to send me a Logitech G903 which IS NOT THE SAME VERSION BUT A NEWER MODEL. And So I was happy with this compromise, I as well couldn't return the defected one which is understandable to a degree, but that didn't stop me from wanting to know the problem of the continuous Bluetooth disconnection. A few weeks pass and I receive the newer mouse in a white box which wasn't the same as a new box; though the representative didn't say if it was new or not so I didn't care at the end of the day. There wasn't visible use of the mouse (no fingerprints, plastic still protecting the bottom, all parts included) after a week of Bluetooth use the problems persisted.-Using Bluetooth will make the mouse turn on and off which makes the cursor reappear in a new spot(this was annoying when I would play videogames and the constant sounds going on and off as well)-The battery wasn't accurate as well, I would have to charge it for an hour or more to see it fully charge and have the Bluetooth fail on me again. I would figure Problem 1 and 2 went hand in hand.-Yes I did try both mice on different Laptops/PC's and still had the same problem.-Yes I've done everything in my power to test the adapter as well, from different ports to disabling NVIDIA settings etc.Now you're thinking I'm not considering buying this mouse. I couldn't agree more, BUT I did love Logitech's customer support, and this Logitech G900/G903 will not steer me away from their other mice I will consider buying in the future.

The expense and headache never end (7 years now). The exception to the rule = Corsair’s XD7 water loop system. I must come out of the shadows with this thing.If you are on a budget = stop reading right now… go to the Financial Aid office and ask for money to support your bad computer habit (cuz you are in trouble dude).Even if this ‘work of art’ fails tomorrow, I will enjoy this moment. I give THANOS credit to the engineering and designers of this pump. It makes perfect sense and saves a lot of space in an EATX case (or perhaps smaller).Along with this unit – the picture shows the Corsair XC7 RGB (CPU cold plate) and the Corsair XG7 RGB (GPU water block / cold plate). And I never thought I would be staring at my own …. for three days without blinking my eyes. (see photo)Tech Specs:> The XG7 (Rev B) is a perfect fit for my EVGA 2080 XC – which is a reference card (meaning NVIDIA gives the reference and EVGA slaps two fans and a shroud over the …..) If your card is bigger than a reference size (10.5 inches long) – then you will likely shed tears finding the correct block (sorry). The problem for many is thickness (like capacitors and extra cooling junk).> The XC7 is a perfect fit for my Intel socket LGA 1200 processor (or any other); Corsair gives you the back plate and spring-loaded screws which can be mounted to where they don’t flop around on install.Advice:Remember: this is just a water pump with pretty lights and outrageous plumbing. The rest is up to you and extensive research. I had to watch several YOUTUBE videos that didn’t teach me nothing about setting up a custom loop (good for reference only or nothing at all). Takes a bit of time…But I know one rule = buy two of everything you can’t find at WALMART or BESTBUY. I needed (12) compression fittings (which come 4 to a box). I needed (2) 90-degree fittings. I did the calculations before I started. Surprisingly, the Corsair hose and coolant (1000 ml) was enough to do the entire build (can’t waste nothing testing).Hope this helps…",true,1,21,"121","B08HSQV5NZ","corsair darkcore",false,154.99,"USD",0,0,0,448,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HSQV5NZ","2016.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Hydro X Series XD5 RGB Pump/Reservoir Combo - D5 PWM Pump - 330ml Reservoir - Ten Individually Addr...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Bw1KiAW8L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R3DODNDM886YTD","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2021",1,"Loud, unreliable, and poorly made product","I have used Corsair products for a long time, so I was expecting a quality item like the peripherals I trust. However, this cooler was an extreme let-down to the point where I won't let any Corsair AIO coolers near my rig again. Here's the skinny:- The install was very frustrating. The radiator I received had holes that were very poorly tapped, with a large amount of metal shavings obstructing the threads. It was so bad that even the right sized Philips bit would torque right out of the head rather than threading it in, I nearly punctured the radiator just trying to thread in the screws thanks to this.- The cooler isn't that effective when it does work, the laughably poorly designed fans cavitate something awful all the time. This means it's annoyingly loud at idle and completely deafening under any load.- The software is AWFUL. I have a lot of experience with iCue; It's a great program for tuning the functionality of non-mission-critical PC components. Its reliability is spotty at best though, it tends to crash every once in a while when it's in the background tray. The buggy software combined with the complete necessity of the AIO pump running is a recipe for disaster.- To further elaborate, this cooler needs to plug into a USB header on the mobo to work, and the computer considers it a USB device after you boot up. But then every time iCue crashes, the software control of the AIO fails too, meaning the pump will briefly shut off. The USB connect also means every other USB connected device will also be disconnected from the computer, meaning it starts to overheat and you can't do anything to stop it short of yanking the power cord.- The fix for the above issue is to *wait for it* update the firmware through iCue. To do this, you click a button in the software and it does its thing. Except, it actually doesn't, it just shuts off the AIO completely while waiting for a response that will never come and you get to watch your CPU rapidly cook itself alive.

"RU9F8JG0WBAVB","Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020",5,"Great mouse, as advertised","Was a bit wary going in buying a renewed product, but there was no need. Mouse and 3 grip attachments came safely packaged in great condition. People have complained about the iCUE software, but I don't find it too difficult so long as you do a little bit of research to help yourself out. One important note on that; you can change both the ""hardware actions/lighting"" settings (the default behavior of the lights and programmable buttons when iCUE is NOT running, and have to be saved to the mouse when changed) and the regular ""actions/lighting"" settings (those that take over when iCUE is running, and you can set up different profiles to switch between). The nice thing is you can customize the mouse to your liking and have those settings saved without having iCUE running, or if you need the mouse to be able to adapt to different programs/games etc... you can leave iCUE running and it'll take care of it without needing to re-open the settings and adjust each time.When it comes to the mouse itself, I'm enjoying it so far. Mouse wheel has nice texture and is very responsive, and the two side buttons are in a great spot depending on your grip; and if you prefer one over the other depending on your grip you can easily customize them. On that, it's worth noting; the two side buttons default to serving as the ""back"" and ""forward"" features when navigating the internet which is a nice feature, but you can easily change it if you like. The two buttons in front of the mouse wheel are labelled as the DPI buttons and their default function changes between different DPI levels; however you can also remap these buttons in the same way.The lighting customization is a bit tricky to figure out only because of how many options there are. I'm content with just 1 or 2 solid lights, but the combinations are extensive. Also of note is that the 5 lit bars on the top indicate the DPI profiles you can switch between, and the lighting settings for them is separate in the DPI section of iCUE. The one common complaint I've seen noted is that the lights tend to get warm, but I've found that turning the brightness of the lighting down in the general iCUE settings has prevented this issue so far for me.I have generally larger hands and the mouse fits me reasonably well. I used to use a wrist rest for my mouse but, again depending on the grip, I have found the mouse just as, if not more, comfortable to use without the wrist rest. I don't really have a ""go-to"" grip so to speak, but so far I'd say I've favored a fingertip grip thus far, and is just as comfortable with a full palm grip; the mouse has a very ergonomic shape if this is what you favor, I find it very comfortable.Very important but also quite silly, there is plastic over all the pads on the bottom of the mouse and the bottom of the largest grip attachment... but the plastic is so thin and subtle that I didn't notice them at first. Once one of them started to roll up on the bottom and I then peeled them all off the mouse felt much smoother.",true,1,4,"13","B07XJ4HKZH","corsair glaive",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,102,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ4HKZH","479.40",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR Glaive Pro - RGB Gaming Mouse - Comfortable & Ergonomic - Interchangeable Grips - 18,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Alum...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616awOPumeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I had used Corsair products before and was very satisfied was their quality and in my mouse search found this little ""gem"" the CorsairGlaive PRO.I guess at 67 years old I need a more conservative-looking mouse instead of one that looks at home on a Klingon battlecruiser. Not saying the Glaive PRO is a ""grandpa"" mouse as it delivers great performance and is easy on the pocketbook. Durability will be the big unknown in this purchase as I have never owned a Corsair mouse. So far it is proving to be a very good value. Though not a Mad Catz with an assortment of accessories including customizable weights to get that ultimate ""gamer"" feel the Corsair Glaive PRO doesn't cost $200+ either which is enough to make any Grandpa smile. It does have three thumb rest pieces that attach securely magnetically, however.

Mir ging es hierum, dass ich anfangen wollte von jedem Hersteller die Peripheriegeräte zu testen, weil ich eigentlich immer nur Razer oder Logitech hatte. Mein Arbeitskollege empfohl mir Corsair.TL:DRPros:- gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis- modular wechselbare Daumenablagen- gutes Gewicht und gute Größe (für manche vllt etwas zu leicht)Cons:- Mausrad wirkt nicht wirklich hochwertig- DPI-Knöpfe zu leicht auslösbar- wird sehr schnell heiß, wenn die LEDs an sind (nur über Software ausschaltbar)Ich habe sie für 70€ erworben und für diesen Preis finde ich die Qualität grundlegend gut, die Glaive fühlt sich gut an, ist weder zu schwer noch zu leicht für mich (andere würden sagen, dass sie zu leicht ist) und bietet durch die auswechselbaren Module an der linken Seite der Maus auch ein gutes Gefühl für den Daumen. Die Knöpfe der Maus selber fühlen sich gut an, jedoch sind die DPI-Knöpfe zu leicht zu drücken, weshalb manchmal schon simples streichen über sie, diese auslöst.

"R1QSI4BJ82MERT","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",5,"Didn't expect would be that good","This is the kind of product you are not sure you really need until you get it and wonder how you could manage to live without it. With all the not so good reviews, especially about the screen, I hesitated for a long time before to buy it but when I got some money as a gift from a aunt I decided to try it.First of all, the device looks very good quality and it sticks very well to my K95. The buttons and widgets are easy to setup with iCUE and you can configure them as you like (color, size, background image, etc.). You can only set 6 buttons per screen but you can set as many screens as you want and it's easy to switch between them by swiping with your finger. I switched from a two monitors setup to a single 32"" one a year ago and I was missing very much to be able to monitor my temperatures while gaming without having to run some overlay programs. Turns out that thing does it wonderfully well.Unlike some other people said I didn't notice any increase of CPU usage after I connected it (but maybe it's because my Ryzen 5900x just doesn't feel it).About the screen, it's true that if you look at it from an angle you don't see anything anymore but... this thing is not supposed to be looked at from a 45 degree angle. It is supposed to be watched when you are in front of your keyboard and when you do that it's amazingly clear and bright. My only negative point is that the touch functionality when you press a button is not always super reactive but I realize that it works fine if you aim more toward the bottom of the screen instead of the top. In that way it works just fine.Overall, it's an expansive device but for me it worth it.

Just the right amount of buttons for the type of gaming I do.If you are a WOW or DOTA player you may find this lacking but this mouse is for FPS and other shooters. The sniper button is INCREDIBLY useful. I though of it more as a gimmick at first but no it makes such a huge difference in the fine aiming for high zoom weapons or vehicles.As far as ergonomics I have fairly large hands and it fits great. The thumb rest keeps your hand on the mouse and off the pad to make for smooth movement and less drag and the ability to change the weight is more valuable than I first assumed.I picked this up on sale and I think the price point is very fair for what you are getting.

Ergonomics are pretty good, but I find myself sometimes accidentally tapping the thumb buttons or the adjustment buttons under the mouse wheel. The mouse wheel developed a squeak after a month or two. The LEDs are obnoxious, unless you turn them down or off. Which you can do, but that brings us to the software.You must install the Razer apps in order to configure the mouse. You must register to Razer's site and log on via the app. Sometimes, the app forgets your login for some reason (I assume after an update), and you have to log in again. But the updates are the real problem. There are many, many software updates. When there's a new update, every time you log in to your computer, even after waking it of sleep, the big neon green Razer Central screen jumps out at you to tell you that there are app updates. ""Fine"", you think, ""I'll just disable auto updates""'. There's even an option to do so in the settings. The problem? It. Doesn't. Work. It will keep on pestering you every single time they release some update, which happens every week or two. And what's worse, every update requires a reboot. If you don't reboot? It will keep pestering you. Disable the Razer services? The big Razer logo on the mouse will glow a bright, neon green. I've seen discussions on the forums about what firewall ports to disable in order to prevent Razer's apps from phoning home, but that's really way more trouble than I'm willing to go through for a mouse.Simply the worst experience with software I can remember in a very long time.

I figured I was just unlucky and grabbed another because I really like the design of the mouse and how it feels in my hand. However, I am already having issues with this mouse giving the double click issue as well, this time with the right mouse button. I've had this one for even less time than the previous. For something that costs 80 dollars this really isn't acceptable and I will be switching to a different brand for my next one.Also, iCue is the worst software package I have ever used, and is basically required to get any sort of functionality out of the mmo buttons on the side.The Logitech mmo mouse (G600) while not looking nearly as attractive lasted me for about 5 years before I finally gave it to a friend after picking up my first Scimitar. He's still using that mouse. It also comes in at half the price and has a ""better"" software setup. Not that Logi's is amazing either, but it's far better than iCue.

It does not feel like I'm pressing a button, more like reaching for something unsecured and difficult to push.The clickers need to pressed rather than lightly touched.

Think about slamming your hand flat on a table, this is what it feels like to press the clickers.Something more annoying than the buttons is the failure to load.

"R3NGDI5C3VV8QO","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"TERRIBLE. Scroll Wheel WILL Start to Squeak and Fail After 3 Months.","For the first few months, it was good. Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches. It's the most frustrating thing I've experienced with a mouse and I've finally given up and am purchasing a different one.

Within 6 months, I noticed the left-click was not holding down correctly. Physically it felt fine, but it was basically unplayable in games. I tried every solution and the problem only got worse over time so I figured it was a hardware problem rather than a software issue. I took great care of the mouse and used it VERY lightly yet it still gave out quickly. Not to mention the Razer Synapse program is terrible. Unfortunately for me, the company that sold me the product through Amazon, ""TECHLOBBY"", is not an authorized seller of Razer products so the 2 year manufacturers warranty did NOT cover this issue.

"R36OOOSV99KWVV","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2021",4,"Good mouse, no doubt about it, but beware if you have larger hands","First of all I'll preface by saying that I'm unsure if the issue of my assigned keybinds resetting was an issue of ICUE software or if it's an issue with Windows 11. Either way, it's something to be noted that there's the possibility of your ICUE software resetting or scrambling your assigned keybinds when you reboot your PC. This issue won't affect the score I gave it since I can't pinpoint the exact cause of it.What will affect it however, is it's size. For a gaming mouse, the form factor is surprisingly small. I wear a medium/large size glove and this mouse was exceptionally uncomfortable if you're using it for it's defining feature: the programmable buttons on the left. In my natural mouse grip, my thumb rests on the frontmost row of buttons, making 123/456 the easiest to access. The 789 row just behind it is a bit uncomfortable to reach. The 10/11/12 row is very difficult without shifting my hand back on the mouse or curling my thumb too far inward, which is unnatural for me personally and made using the mouse significantly more difficult than I had previously expected. And yes, this is with the number buttons slid as far to the front as I could with the adjustment screw.Additionally, the buttons themselves are very small and feature very little textural difference to help distinguish them besides some very light texturing on alternating rows. Pressing multiple buttons or pressing the wrong button is very common, more common than I would like. Between the buttons being small, being hard to distinguish one from the other, and having larger hands make utilizing the full potential of this mouse extremely difficult.Finally, the left and right clickers are very light. The weight of my middle finger alone is enough to cause the right clicker to go off.My verdict is that the mouse is potentially very good, especially if your hands are on the smaller side. Gamers with larger hands might find this mouse uncomfortable to use if you prefer to choke up on the mouse like I do. I wouldn't *not* recommend it, but I would definitely keep the size of the mouse itself and the buttons in mind when making the recommendation.",true,1,10,"19","B082LRMY53","corsair harpoon",true,69.99,"USD",79.99,10,12.5,1867,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LRMY53","8214.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite, MOBA/MMO Gaming Mouse, Black, Backlit RGB LED, 18000 DPI, Optical","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614J0VriTRL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The wire is high quality braided like all of their other devices. The software is simple and user friendly. The weights and software customization are incredible I like a heavy mouse and super low DPI for shooters with a high polling rate and this m65 is perfect. Just the right amount of buttons for the type of gaming I do.If you are a WOW or DOTA player you may find this lacking but this mouse is for FPS and other shooters. The sniper button is INCREDIBLY useful. I though of it more as a gimmick at first but no it makes such a huge difference in the fine aiming for high zoom weapons or vehicles.As far as ergonomics I have fairly large hands and it fits great. The thumb rest keeps your hand on the mouse and off the pad to make for smooth movement and less drag and the ability to change the weight is more valuable than I first assumed.I picked this up on sale and I think the price point is very fair for what you are getting.

Ergonomics are pretty good, but I find myself sometimes accidentally tapping the thumb buttons or the adjustment buttons under the mouse wheel. The mouse wheel developed a squeak after a month or two. The LEDs are obnoxious, unless you turn them down or off. Which you can do, but that brings us to the software.You must install the Razer apps in order to configure the mouse. You must register to Razer's site and log on via the app. Sometimes, the app forgets your login for some reason (I assume after an update), and you have to log in again. But the updates are the real problem. There are many, many software updates. When there's a new update, every time you log in to your computer, even after waking it of sleep, the big neon green Razer Central screen jumps out at you to tell you that there are app updates. ""Fine"", you think, ""I'll just disable auto updates""'. There's even an option to do so in the settings. The problem? It. Doesn't. Work. It will keep on pestering you every single time they release some update, which happens every week or two. And what's worse, every update requires a reboot. If you don't reboot? It will keep pestering you. Disable the Razer services? The big Razer logo on the mouse will glow a bright, neon green. I've seen discussions on the forums about what firewall ports to disable in order to prevent Razer's apps from phoning home, but that's really way more trouble than I'm willing to go through for a mouse.Simply the worst experience with software I can remember in a very long time.

"R12ZP43LF7BB99","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021",4,"Good, But Could Be Better","I upgraded to this from the Corsair HS35 because I wanted a wireless headset so that I wouldn't have to remove the headset and miss out on stuff every time I had to step away.The order arrived completely intact and without incident the day after I placed my order.I tested it out immediately, and I have been using it consistently for about a week now.It definitely serves its intended purpose (to give me a wireless option).The range on it is pretty good.I am able to walk all around the ground floor of my house and even walk outside my front door to pickup deliveries and still maintain connection.However, sometimes the connection is spotty, regardless of how far away I am from my computer, including sometimes if I am sitting right in front of it.I notice that sometimes, as I am walking away from the computer, if I move to fast, it takes time for it to catch up, so it's kind of in-and-out.But whenever I have such connection issues, usually if I power it down, remove the dongle from the USB port, re-insert it, and turn the headphones back on, the connection issues disappear.Some other things that I dislike about this:1.Size:it is adjustable, but even at its smallest, it is still a little loose on my head (for reference, my hat size is 7 1/2, although that doesn't exactly translate to a headset).While the HS35 fits perfectly, because these are a little loose, the band doesn't sit on top of my head, so my ears are really the only thing supporting it, and pretty often I can feel it slipping down on my ears, so I have to adjust it.2.When I did some testing, the recordings I did with this mic were not as clear and crisp as the ones I did with the HS35 mic.The speakers, however, seem to be pretty comparable.Other than the freedom of a wireless headset, one thing that I did like about this is that it comes with it's own windscreen, which is pretty important to me because there is a lot of background noise in the room where I use it.The windscreen does a good job filtering out the background noise.And because it comes with one, it is a perfect fit.The HS35 did not come with one, so I had to by some separately (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EJ0N5FS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which do not fit perfectly, and fall off frequently.Overall, I am pleased with Corsair HS70.For the price, you will not find a better wireless headset.Overall, I like the HS35 better, but the freedom that the wireless HS70 provides is definitely enough to make it my primary headset for the time being.I am giving it 4 stars, but it's probably more like a 3.5.I went back and forth between 3 and 4, but in the end, I felt 3 was a little too harsh.So, yes.Four stars, but really more like a 3.5.",true,1,2,"11","B07X9W721J","corsair hs",true,79.99,"USD",99.99,20,20,3479,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9W721J","14959.70",false,false,false,false,"Corsair HS70 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset - 7.1 Surround Sound Headphones for PC, MacOS, PS5, PS4 - Discord Certified - 50m...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XjjJovijL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Before the end-of-January, I had to send them back cut to a component failure. As shown in the pictures, they use a plastic cover piece to secure the headphones and hold them in place with metal screws going into plastic parts. As you adjust the headphones to your head (my wife & son share these) you are constantly re-adjusting to a comfortable fit. This is the problem. I just had my second pair fail, due to the same issue. Only this time around we were ""on guard"", to be extremely careful when adjusting. They failed on me today as I was on a TEAMS Chat conference call. The headset works fantastic. The features are great. Adjustable sound, mute, removable boom mike. All great and work fantastically. BUT, one of the most important components in the build is made from very thin, cheap, plastic.

But without it the sound eq settings were alright, but with the bass boost setting it somehow kills sound all together making it really quiet.

The Cups feel really comfy and also fit nice around my fat ears!

And the HS80 delivers it!All the other niceties one would expect from a quality Corsair product are there - very sturdy build, huge ear cups, very comfortable headrest with the adjustable strap - no pressure on the ears at all! Plus, I've spent some time playing with the Dolby Atmos software in Windows 10, switching between enhanced Movie and Music modes - and this actually helps a lot to experience surround sound like never before.

"R2NJCXPJ9V2VB3","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",3,"Average sound quality, quiet mic, not that comfortable","I bought into all the YouTube reviews hyping this headset. Bought a pair to see for myself and they didn’t meet expectations. Maybe it was due to all the reviews. The material and aesthetics are good and feel premium, but there were too many downsides for me to keep them.Out of the box sound quality is pretty average at best, with weak bass. Note, I never messed with the EQ settings so it's possible this can be fixed with some tweaking. Games might sound fine and if you don’t care about really good sound quality for anything else.Mic quality is actually really solid, but unfortunately really quiet. I’m sure you can increase it with some software, but Corsair should really fix that on their end. The red LED when the mic is in the mute position can get pretty distracting if on a video conference as there is no way to turn it off.For me, it wasn't super comfortable, although you can probably still wear them for long sessions without issues. I have a medium to large head and the strap is enough for me. It feels a bit too heavy and the clamping force is on the strong side.The on/off button has some issues. At times, it seems like the button doesn't register and you have to press and hold a couple of times on the right position. I even got a replacement thinking it was just that headset, but it had the same issue. I could have lived with it, if not for all the other issues.If you really just need a wireless headset with a good mic and are fine with everything else, this could work for you. I really wanted to like them, but for $150, I personally don’t think it’s worth it with all the downsides. If it was priced around $100, I might have kept them.",true,1,7,"17","B09BBPTDWX","corsair hs",false,149.99,"USD",0,0,0,34,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BBPTDWX","136.00",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR HS80 RGB Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with Spatial Audio - Works with Mac, PC, PS5, PS4 - Carbon","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SzBbPQQeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
"R4K5DDTJXA51Z","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",4,"Very impressive!","If I’m being honest, the reviews almost had me running the other direction. I decided to take a leap and give them a shot anyway, and I’m glad I did! I’m a bit of an audiophile and usually rely on a dedicated amp/usb mic/audiophile cans for my gaming needs, but I wanted something wireless that I could also use on my ps5. I’ve tried many other headsets some of which included Jbl Quantum 800s, Steelseries Arctis 7ps, Audeze Penrose, and Beoplay Portals. Although, all of those are good headsets in their own right, something about them that caused me to lose interest and ultimately either return or even sell them for a loss. Generally it was either comfort, connection issues, low volume on console, or poor quality mic that was the leading culprit.Now the HS80s at $150 do everything right while managing to do nothing offensively wrong. They aren’t perfect by any means but what they manage to do at that price point is sound fantastic, have a stable connection, are extremely comfortable, and have the best wireless mic I have ever used. They also work seamlessly on PS5 and get so loud that no person using them would need to go higher than 60%.The only fault I can give these are due to software alone. For people that have used ICUE you already know the issues, but for people that haven’t, it can be particular and require some finesse to get everything working right. One issue I have is every time I turn them on they default to 8 channel audio regardless of them being set to stereo in ICUE. It’s not a huge deal you just go into your sound settings on windows and change it to 2 channel 24 bit 48khz and they sound amazing after that.

"RLYFSK6IKTRUJ","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021",3,"Narrow earcups and very quiet microphone","TLDR the audio is great with light tuning in the EQ and the microphone QUALITY is amazing, but the overall mic volume is too low for me, even with Windows settings maxed out, and the earcups are a tad narrow causing some constant light pressure along the back of my ear, especially if walking around.If the microphone volume was acceptable I could have lived with the earcups.The audio quality out of the box wasn't the best, the mids are a bit too strong and muddle the highs.Messing with the eq and raising the highs gave an amazing sound which is among the best in headsets at this price range, from my experience. The sound is a little richer and cleaner than what I get from my Arctis 7s.The cloth earcups do mean you miss a bit of the bass, but I didn't find the experience lacking since the mids were stronger and helped fill the gap.This headset doesn't offer any 3d audio or surround sound simulations.The microphone was probably the best and worst thing about this headset at the same time.For a wireless headset, the quality of this microphone is ASTOUNDING.I've used a Blue Yeti and AT2020USB as desk microphones in the past and on a purely quality review, this microphone is right there with them for anything but the purest audiophile.Where the microphone suffers is the volume.I'm unsure if my model was defective (due to other concerns below I didn't choose to replace to see and instead did a refund), but even with every mic setting I could find in Windows and the Corsair software maxed out, my friend had to set me to 200% in discord compared to my Arctis 1s or 7s at a normal 100%.If you plan to also use this as a work headset as well, the volume might not be great for zoom or teams calls.I did not test to see how much this microphone could be boosted in OBS capture for streaming.The fit of the headband support is great and the inside adjustments are good if slightly limited, but the earcups were a bit too narrow for me.The memory foam compresses nicely, but when work there was a mild constant pressure against the back of my ears.For normal sitting and gaming it was fine, but since it is wireless, getting up and walking around made it was noticeable for any tiny movements of the headset.Apart from the ears, the overall clamp and fit was perfect though - my Arctis 7 which uses a similar elastic strap system was always too loose for my head and slipped around heavily when walking or bending, but this never seemed at risk of sliding off.",true,1,7,"17","B09BBPTDWX","corsair hs",false,149.99,"USD",0,0,0,34,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BBPTDWX","136.00",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR HS80 RGB Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with Spatial Audio - Works with Mac, PC, PS5, PS4 - Carbon","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SzBbPQQeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R31EP96A289O2C","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2021",3,"Some limitations on PC","I bought these to use with a PC and an Xbox wireless adapter which is where my rating comes from.Sound quality and mic quality seemed good.Comfort was great.I loved how these felt while I was wearing them.The earpads were thick and soft.Also, the thing I really liked about this headset when used with the wireless adapter is Windows 10 will recognize when you turn the headset on and change your speaker output to headphones and will switch it back to speakers when you turn the headset off again.This is not something easy to do with any other headset.However, when using this headset on a PC the volume of the headset resets every time you power cycle them.So, every single time you go to use it you have to adjust the volume.Also, the microphone monitoring (sidetone) turns back on if you have previously turned it off every time you power cycle the headset.These two issues are really annoying.There should be a memory setting to keep the volume and mic monitoring where you have it set.I understand mic monitoring can be a useful tool but I do not want to hear myself and my environment coming though my headphones.I am using them to chat in games occasionally and not to stream from or talk into for hours so I just don't want the mic monitoring active and it is annoying turning it off every time I use the headset.I am guessing these are not issues when using the headset on an Xbox but I am using it for PC which is supposed to be a supported use case.The 7.1 surround is even PC exclusive.Also, there is no equalizer settings or anything else you can change when using these on PC.Some of Corsair's cheaper headsets have equalizer settings you can change on PC in the icue software.The only thing you can do on PC with these is update the firmware.It is possible a future firmware could address these issues but I kind of doubt it as I am not sure they are even considered bugs.The reason I believe this is because the volume wheel on these is like an infinite wheel where there is no start or stop point.You can just turn it forever which means some sort of software or programming needs to keep track of where the volume is at rather than the position of the volume wheel like on other headsets.Anyway, there were some nice thing about this headset.The automatic speaker/headset switching is really nice in Windows.I wish all wireless headsets could do that but I believe it is because you are using the Xbox wireless adapter that makes it possible with these.Unfortunately, for the way I want to use a headset the volume and mic monitoring issues are not something I can live with.I would give this a 3.5 out of 5 if I could.",true,1,8,"18","B08JD18Q4Q","corsair hs",false,146.99,"USD",0,0,0,241,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JD18Q4Q","988.10",false,false,false,false,"Corsair HS75 XB Wireless Gaming Headset for Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KAi95uo-L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,1,"10","B07QX9C9WH","corsair ironclaw",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,4,"13","B07QX9C9WH","corsair ironclaw",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Just the right amount of buttons for the type of gaming I do.If you are a WOW or DOTA player you may find this lacking but this mouse is for FPS and other shooters. The sniper button is INCREDIBLY useful. I though of it more as a gimmick at first but no it makes such a huge difference in the fine aiming for high zoom weapons or vehicles.As far as ergonomics I have fairly large hands and it fits great. The thumb rest keeps your hand on the mouse and off the pad to make for smooth movement and less drag and the ability to change the weight is more valuable than I first assumed.I picked this up on sale and I think the price point is very fair for what you are getting.

"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

"R36OOOSV99KWVV","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2021",4,"Good mouse, no doubt about it, but beware if you have larger hands","First of all I'll preface by saying that I'm unsure if the issue of my assigned keybinds resetting was an issue of ICUE software or if it's an issue with Windows 11. Either way, it's something to be noted that there's the possibility of your ICUE software resetting or scrambling your assigned keybinds when you reboot your PC. This issue won't affect the score I gave it since I can't pinpoint the exact cause of it.What will affect it however, is it's size. For a gaming mouse, the form factor is surprisingly small. I wear a medium/large size glove and this mouse was exceptionally uncomfortable if you're using it for it's defining feature: the programmable buttons on the left. In my natural mouse grip, my thumb rests on the frontmost row of buttons, making 123/456 the easiest to access. The 789 row just behind it is a bit uncomfortable to reach. The 10/11/12 row is very difficult without shifting my hand back on the mouse or curling my thumb too far inward, which is unnatural for me personally and made using the mouse significantly more difficult than I had previously expected. And yes, this is with the number buttons slid as far to the front as I could with the adjustment screw.Additionally, the buttons themselves are very small and feature very little textural difference to help distinguish them besides some very light texturing on alternating rows. Pressing multiple buttons or pressing the wrong button is very common, more common than I would like. Between the buttons being small, being hard to distinguish one from the other, and having larger hands make utilizing the full potential of this mouse extremely difficult.Finally, the left and right clickers are very light. The weight of my middle finger alone is enough to cause the right clicker to go off.My verdict is that the mouse is potentially very good, especially if your hands are on the smaller side. Gamers with larger hands might find this mouse uncomfortable to use if you prefer to choke up on the mouse like I do. I wouldn't *not* recommend it, but I would definitely keep the size of the mouse itself and the buttons in mind when making the recommendation.",true,1,13,"112","B082LRMY53","corsair ironclaw",true,69.99,"USD",79.99,10,12.5,1867,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LRMY53","8214.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite, MOBA/MMO Gaming Mouse, Black, Backlit RGB LED, 18000 DPI, Optical","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614J0VriTRL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

However, less than 3 days later the left mouse button started failing to work. I have to now click the left mouse button 3 to 4 times to get it to register much like my Razer started doing before I purchased this mouse. If i blow under the left mouse button it starts working again for a few minutes but once the static charge builds back up, it starts failing again.

"R1QSI4BJ82MERT","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",5,"Didn't expect would be that good","This is the kind of product you are not sure you really need until you get it and wonder how you could manage to live without it. With all the not so good reviews, especially about the screen, I hesitated for a long time before to buy it but when I got some money as a gift from a aunt I decided to try it.First of all, the device looks very good quality and it sticks very well to my K95. The buttons and widgets are easy to setup with iCUE and you can configure them as you like (color, size, background image, etc.). You can only set 6 buttons per screen but you can set as many screens as you want and it's easy to switch between them by swiping with your finger. I switched from a two monitors setup to a single 32"" one a year ago and I was missing very much to be able to monitor my temperatures while gaming without having to run some overlay programs. Turns out that thing does it wonderfully well.Unlike some other people said I didn't notice any increase of CPU usage after I connected it (but maybe it's because my Ryzen 5900x just doesn't feel it).About the screen, it's true that if you look at it from an angle you don't see anything anymore but... this thing is not supposed to be looked at from a 45 degree angle. It is supposed to be watched when you are in front of your keyboard and when you do that it's amazingly clear and bright. My only negative point is that the touch functionality when you press a button is not always super reactive but I realize that it works fine if you aim more toward the bottom of the screen instead of the top. In that way it works just fine.Overall, it's an expansive device but for me it worth it.

This is not a knock against them, as every other product of theirs I've bought (which is many) has served me well, but the G610 was failing earlier than expected. So I needed a new keyboard.Every Corsair product I've ever bought significantly exceeded my expectations. This naturally causes my expectations to rise still further, and this keyboard still beat them. The Cherry Speed switches are quieter than what my last keyboard had, which I love. The required pressing force and travel to actuate them are quite light, which is great for extended use to prevent finger fatigue. Just make sure you're able to only hit the keys you want to press. Accidental actuation is possible.It's noticeably narrower than my G610. I've reclaimed about 3 inches of width on my desk. The spacebar is textured for some reason, but it's fine with me. So is the removable wrist rest, which makes a little more sense. There are 3 brightness settings, plus off. The brightest should be easily visible unless you're standing in direct sunlight at midday. The dimmest won't be irritating in a darkened room.It has a USB pass-through, which requires plugging in a second cable. This is optional and the keyboard will work just fine with only the one cable plugged in (make sure it's the right one; they are labeled). It comes with several replacement keys, and a tool to help replace keys.I did not want to spend $200 on their newest flagship board.

With all the not so good reviews, especially about the screen, I hesitated for a long time before to buy it but when I got some money as a gift from a aunt I decided to try it.First of all, the device looks very good quality and it sticks very well to my K95. The buttons and widgets are easy to setup with iCUE and you can configure them as you like (color, size, background image, etc.). You can only set 6 buttons per screen but you can set as many screens as you want and it's easy to switch between them by swiping with your finger. I switched from a two monitors setup to a single 32"" one a year ago and I was missing very much to be able to monitor my temperatures while gaming without having to run some overlay programs. Turns out that thing does it wonderfully well.Unlike some other people said I didn't notice any increase of CPU usage after I connected it (but maybe it's because my Ryzen 5900x just doesn't feel it).About the screen, it's true that if you look at it from an angle you don't see anything anymore but... this thing is not supposed to be looked at from a 45 degree angle. It is supposed to be watched when you are in front of your keyboard and when you do that it's amazingly clear and bright. My only negative point is that the touch functionality when you press a button is not always super reactive but I realize that it works fine if you aim more toward the bottom of the screen instead of the top. In that way it works just fine.Overall, it's an expansive device but for me it worth it.

It does not happen every time, but often when I try to type an ""A"" it ends up writing ""AA"" or ""AAA"". It does not happen every time I press the button either, which only makes it more annoying. As another reviewer noted, this seems to be due to using WASD keys more than the others.In addition, I find that the spacebar is difficult to use in some games. Unless I perfectly hit it in the middle on every press, it will over time begin to slope downward to the left (when my left hand is on WASD my thumb naturally falls just left of the center of the spacebar). This eventually results in the spacebar not registering all of my presses until I press down on the right side and get it back to level.Lastly, switching between users on my computer often causes the keyboard software to glitch and refuse to work until I unplug the USB and plug it back in.None of these issues seem like major concerns, but I bought this keyboard thinking that it would last longer than 3 years. I guess Corsair just does not build them to last.",true,1,8,"17","B01N5IISXY","corsair k100",true,159.59,"USD",199.99,40.4,20.2,5028,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5IISXY","23128.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - 6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Fast...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71niQiKL9lL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R5MY12VKEAJE2","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021",2,"Ok at first, but the keys break quickly","I really like this keyboard at first, I was a little concerned with how loud the keys were and if they would be disruptive on a conference call, but people said they couldn’t really hear them. My major problem with this keyboard is the keys start to break.The plastic that makes up the cross pattern that connects the key to the keyboard seems to be very weak. Within about 2 months or so of owning it, the left side control key broke. To Corsairs credit they sent me a replacement key very quickly, but a few months after that the right control key started to come loose.What I have noticed is it is the keys that are around the edge of the keyboard that have the issue. What I believe it to be is it is the keys that you aren’t pressing at a straight up and down, it is the keys that you are reaching over to with your pinky fingers that are really the problem. I have a feeling overtime they would all start to break down, but the ones that are getting more pressure at an angle are just breaking first.Long story short, I replacing this and going back to my trusted Logitech keyboard because, while their customer service was great, I can’t be waiting for replacement keys every couple months.If this is primarily used for gaming and not a combination of day-to-day and gaming I would say it will last you a while, but if you’re thinking about getting this for your day-to-day I wouldn’t recommend it.",true,1,8,"17","B01N5IISXY","corsair k100",true,159.59,"USD",199.99,40.4,20.2,5028,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5IISXY","23128.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - 6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Fast...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71niQiKL9lL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I use it for intense MMO gaming and it provides everything I require. It is a bit loud but expected for this type of keyboard. the keys off to the left to create macros. I've never created any before this and use the Icue system it was realitivly easy to figure out but there was a slight learning curve through guess and check but got everything working the way i wanted. Lightning is great and customizable. easy to switch it up or just cut it off.Now for the errors. seems to be few. Had to uninstall and reinstall the icue system because it got corrupted two times during my use somehow. Had a few issues reinstalling and getting everything working the 2nd time.The biggest annoyance (at least its something small) is the volume buttons on top right to mute, lower or raise the volume will just stop working. ill restart icue but that wont work. The only way to fix this is either A: restarting the computer sometimes fixes it. B: Go to settings in Icue and force update the firmware. even though you are currently on that firmware you have to force update it so it starts working again. While this is a rather simple fix. I've had this issue for over a year and it still hasn't been fixed but is a known issue (i found it by googling forums)",true,1,8,"17","B01N5IISXY","corsair k100",true,159.59,"USD",199.99,40.4,20.2,5028,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5IISXY","23128.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - 6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Fast...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71niQiKL9lL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"RTZ1UU0TCB7KO","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",2,"Who designed these key faces??!","I used a K70 with brown switches for a few years before it finally kicked the bucket during a move and I decided to throw down some real cash on a new one. While I like the low-profile approach to this keyboard, whoever decided to not only NOT illuminate the shift characters but also flip their position on the key faces is an absolute imbecile and should not have any say on designing a keyboard in this price range. That kind of design decision is something I expect out of the junk keyboards I get when purchasing refurbished computers for my company...not an $185 gaming keyboard.All that said, outside the lighting and stupid character layout decision, the rest of the keyboard works quite nicely. I have a little bit of a ""springy"" sound on my ""s"" key that's been there since day-1 but otherwise no hardware issues to speak of.Software wise, it's really annoying to have to use G-hub constantly if you want this keyboard to be really functional. I say that because without G-hub running the keyboard defaults to a pattern where it flashes all the colors in a big wave which gets incredibly distracting in your peripherals. If you turn off lighting entirely the same idiot that designed these key faces decided to do dark grey on black. It doesn't impact myself as I've spent 8hr+ a day on a keyboard for 15yrs now but if you don't know how to memory type you're going to be up the creek without G-hub running and you're really going to hate finding those rare shift characters.If you're someone just starting out coding this keyboard is especially not for you, you're basically going to be chicken pecking like your dad because you can't see a thing.",true,1,13,"112","B085RFFC9Q","corsair k100",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,5355,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RFFC9Q","25168.50",false,false,false,false,"Logitech G915 TKL Tenkeyless Lightspeed Wireless RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Low Profile Switch Options, LIGHTSYNC RG...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V2O4vbYhL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The purpose was to get a nice full sized board with silent linear switches to replace another small board I was using.The first problem to occur was a constant key spam issue. Support was helpful and RMA'd the unit. The process was archaic and a pain to complete. Requiring RMA numbers all over the box, and a paper trail explaining the issue and why RMA was the resolution. FedEx was way more helpful with the shipping process and getting everything sorted out.Took a week or two to get a new board from Hong Kong which wasn't too slow for the distance. The replacement board immediately had an issue with the Numpad 8 key being chipped on the inside probably from a manufacturing issue. Razer's solution is to replace the entire board for a singular keycap. This is pretty unfortunate and I will just be picking up a custom set of caps.

"R2LZT110IV9KJI","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",1,"Horrible battery life, bad connections","I was excited to receive this keyboard.I had been watching it for a while and finally decided to buy it.It is not cheap, and being a Razer product, I was expecting something really good.Instead, I am returning the keyboard due to really poor performance.After I received the keyboard I immediately removed it from the packaging and plugged it in so it would charge.Once fully charged, I kept the keyboard plugged in via the supplied USB cable to do the setup and customization.I did not want to drain the battery at all during this processes.Once everything was setup, I ""Synced"" the keyboard to the computer using the supplied 2.4 GHz Hyperspeed Dongle.Once all setup was complete, I disconnected the USB cable so I could use it wirelessly.My first issue with the keyboard is how loud it is.I did my research on this keyboard before buying it and selected the Yellow keys - ""silent and linear"".I fully understand mechanical keys are not perfectly silent, but this is the loudest keyboard I have ever used, and I have been in the technology field for a long time, so I have used some old mechanical keyboards.This is the least of my issues with the keyboard, as this could possibly be ignored, but it was an issue, so I wanted to make sure to get it out there that this is a LOUD keyboard.My second issue was the connection.This keyboard would lose connection at times when using the ""Hyperspeed"" connection.I would have to patiently wait a while for it to connect again, or turn the keyboard off and back on again.Please note, the computer is only about 3 feet away from the keyboard with nothing obstructing the signal between the two items.I decided to try the Bluetooth connection...no luck.My computer has no problem detecting other Bluetooth devices, no matter what the device is, the age, or the brand.However, my computer could never ""find"" this keyboard.I even tried making sure it was the only Bluetooth device in the area turned on, and it still never found it.So, my only course of action was to plug the ""wireless"" keyboard in with the supplied USB cable to ensure I would not lose connection with the computer.My third issue.Not sure how to describe this, but it would randomly do things.After having the wireless keyboard plugged in as a wired keyboard (if you can't tell I am frustrated about this, I am), I would be typing and it would randomly open the start menu or task manager.Other times it would just randomly throw up a string of letters that I didn't type.I am not sure how this happened, and only happened a few times before I decided to box this up and start the return process, but it was weird and random.I have never seen that before with.My final issue, and perhaps the most important was the battery life.As I indicated earlier I let the keyboard fully charge before using, and I kept it plugged in while doing the initial setup.I had the keyboard unplugged and working as a wireless keyboard for maybe a little over an hour before reconnecting to become a wired keyboard.Of course, during that time I had the lights going and was using it as a normal keyboard (not gaming, just internet and email) and of course fighting the connection issues.When I pugged the keyboard back in and went back into the Razer Synapse application, I noticed the battery charge had dropped to 76%.WHAT?!?!?!In just over an hour the battery was drained 24%?This is ridiculous.The keyboard I was replacing (and now using for this review) is a wireless backlit keyboard that only needs to be charged once every few months.This keyboard would not even make it through a full day using it as designed with lights active.I could not imagine anyone using this for gaming as it would surely die before the game is finished.So my options now were to either leave the keyboard plugged in, which defeats the purpose of buying a wireless keyboard (and deal with the weird random letters and opening of other applications); or turning the light effects off to save battery life, which defeats the purpose of buying an expensive RGB keyboard.Either way, I would not get what I paid a lot of money for.So, I am returning the keyboard.",true,1,17,"116","B08FQTK1RW","corsair k100",true,179.99,"USD",229.99,50,21.74,682,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FQTK1RW","2932.60",false,false,false,false,"Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro Mechanical Wireless Gaming Keyboard: Green Mechanical Switches - Tactile & Clicky - Chroma RGB Lig...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RyDhL6FjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R29NH6RU20KFL7","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2021",1,"Stopped Connecting to Anything After Just 2 Months of Use","I got this keyboard to replace a Huntsman optical that overall was doing great, but I had an issue with the volume knob (which I use quite regularly) and for me it wasn't the best tying experience for working and gaming. I needed a keyboard that was a little more clicky as I was accidentally hitting other keys with the very short travel of the Huntsman optical. I also wanted wireless so I could pair my work laptop via bluetooth and either connect via a cable or dongle with my personal computer.The Blackwidow V3 Pro at first was amazing. Connected quickly and reliably, the typing experience was much better for my work, the volume knob worked great unlike my Huntsman optical, and the RGB matched perfectly with my other peripherals, and I was in heaven.Then the 2-3 key presses started happening. This wasn't something I noticed with a lot of reviews when I purchased this, but looking back this is a huge problem with this keyboard. This is very problematic depending on what type of game you're playing or if you're pulling double duty and using this keyboard for work. Constantly editing emails or documents was getting very old.I also ran into connection issues after just a month. At first it was just not connecting to bluetooth as quickly, but then if I was using the 2.4Ghz dongle on my personal rig during a game, it would just cut out. It was 3 feet away and within perfect line of sight. Then it got so bad I had to just start plugging it in to game because of random disconnects. It also started randomly flashing the lights.Then today it just stopped connecting to anything. Won't connect to bluetooth, the 2.4ghz dongle or a wired connection. It won't pair with anything new but I was able to reset it and then update the firmware. Then it registers with Synapse if I have it plugged in, but it is still not usable at all. No key presses will register. Also if I press keys while it's connected via the USB cord, it will do random colors like rainbow wave, or do green pulse from where I push the key. The keyboard is entirely useless now after just 2 months.Do not buy this keyboard, or if you do, get a warranty. This is the 2nd Razer keyboard in a row that's had problem. I've typically loved the feel of Razer products, but $500 of peripherals that have either had issues or bit the dust in 2 years is too much.

"R2PDKXMTU02UJH","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2021",2,"Terrible Light Blead and color representation. There are so many better options for your keyboard!","This BEST part of Corsair's newest generation of keyboards is they now use a standard bottom row. This means that you can put almost any keycap set you want on your fancy new keyboard and really make it your own one of a kind keyboard. You are no longer beholden to Corsair's proprietary first party keycap sets. Which is a good thing because these Corsair key caps kind of suck.I've posted some pictures of my K65 keyboard to show what I mean. You can see that the light bleed on these keycaps is just terrible. The red keys in the picture are corsair and the white and blue keycaps are from a third party (drop, I think). On the red switches the entire area around the lettering glows meaning that they are thin in that area. The white switches the only theletter lights up more without the bleed. This is especially true with higher brightness levels and colors closer to white. On the red keycaps when the RGB is set to pure white the color comes through as a deeper pink. The same could be said of the blue third party caps, but it's not nearly as bad.On the upside these keycaps feel good and will fit just about any keyboard, but you can spend the same money and get a much better keycap from places like Drop, Ducky, HyperX or just about anywhere else.Do yourself a favor- look elsewhere.",true,1,20,"119","B0919MMLK4","corsair k100",false,29.99,"USD",0,0,0,926,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0919MMLK4","4259.60",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR PBT Double-Shot PRO Keycap Mod Kit – Double-Shot PBT Keycaps – Origin Red – Standard Bottom Row – Textured Surface...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Vcm4zPnYS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Going to likely and painfully return this horrible product especially after hearing this happen to others.Edit: this product is the most frustrating experience, nothing lights up properly and customer service told me I had to play email tag because their “tech support” doesn’t cover troubleshooting this and the people that do only answer by email. Sometimes 2 fans light up, other times just one but never all 3 and nothing else in the kit has ever lit up as intended. Stay away.This product comes in great packaging and you really feel like you got value for money especially when you tally up the individual items.It’s also not the cheapest, but I wanted to get something higher quality being my first time and all, but this wasn’t quite the case.To begin I learned the pipes were called something that’s just a fancy word for acrylic, and I learned very fast that it’s not very forgiving and easy to mess up. Couple that with the types of adapters you get which pretty much commit you to hardline tubing and you are stuck either with attempting to use them (and in my case immediately messing up a tube despite watching videos prior,) or investing a lot more money to get better tubes or different adapters, but it doesn’t end there…It comes with a squeeze container for filling the pump which broke off inside just from using, that was 2 hours of draining and playing rubik’s cube trying to get out, not fun. But it doesn’t end there either…The pump is awkward as heck, if you have it all plugged in the thing doesn’t operate at full power when filling and you are stuck trying to figure out why the tubes aren’t filling, why does it gotta be like that?The directions aren’t the best, and this process was very painful, I got coolant all over my motherboard and cards despite my best intent to cover everything which yes, is part to user error but I also feel the acrylic isn’t the best use and I wish there were more options from Corsair like being able to buy a kit with soft tubing.

The mechanical switches are of very high quality and seem like they will last for quite awhile.The reason I chose this is so I could also remove the keyboard and use it at a desk (in the future).

"R2LZT110IV9KJI","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",1,"Horrible battery life, bad connections","I was excited to receive this keyboard.I had been watching it for a while and finally decided to buy it.It is not cheap, and being a Razer product, I was expecting something really good.Instead, I am returning the keyboard due to really poor performance.After I received the keyboard I immediately removed it from the packaging and plugged it in so it would charge.Once fully charged, I kept the keyboard plugged in via the supplied USB cable to do the setup and customization.I did not want to drain the battery at all during this processes.Once everything was setup, I ""Synced"" the keyboard to the computer using the supplied 2.4 GHz Hyperspeed Dongle.Once all setup was complete, I disconnected the USB cable so I could use it wirelessly.My first issue with the keyboard is how loud it is.I did my research on this keyboard before buying it and selected the Yellow keys - ""silent and linear"".I fully understand mechanical keys are not perfectly silent, but this is the loudest keyboard I have ever used, and I have been in the technology field for a long time, so I have used some old mechanical keyboards.This is the least of my issues with the keyboard, as this could possibly be ignored, but it was an issue, so I wanted to make sure to get it out there that this is a LOUD keyboard.My second issue was the connection.This keyboard would lose connection at times when using the ""Hyperspeed"" connection.I would have to patiently wait a while for it to connect again, or turn the keyboard off and back on again.Please note, the computer is only about 3 feet away from the keyboard with nothing obstructing the signal between the two items.I decided to try the Bluetooth connection...no luck.My computer has no problem detecting other Bluetooth devices, no matter what the device is, the age, or the brand.However, my computer could never ""find"" this keyboard.I even tried making sure it was the only Bluetooth device in the area turned on, and it still never found it.So, my only course of action was to plug the ""wireless"" keyboard in with the supplied USB cable to ensure I would not lose connection with the computer.My third issue.Not sure how to describe this, but it would randomly do things.After having the wireless keyboard plugged in as a wired keyboard (if you can't tell I am frustrated about this, I am), I would be typing and it would randomly open the start menu or task manager.Other times it would just randomly throw up a string of letters that I didn't type.I am not sure how this happened, and only happened a few times before I decided to box this up and start the return process, but it was weird and random.I have never seen that before with.My final issue, and perhaps the most important was the battery life.As I indicated earlier I let the keyboard fully charge before using, and I kept it plugged in while doing the initial setup.I had the keyboard unplugged and working as a wireless keyboard for maybe a little over an hour before reconnecting to become a wired keyboard.Of course, during that time I had the lights going and was using it as a normal keyboard (not gaming, just internet and email) and of course fighting the connection issues.When I pugged the keyboard back in and went back into the Razer Synapse application, I noticed the battery charge had dropped to 76%.WHAT?!?!?!In just over an hour the battery was drained 24%?This is ridiculous.The keyboard I was replacing (and now using for this review) is a wireless backlit keyboard that only needs to be charged once every few months.This keyboard would not even make it through a full day using it as designed with lights active.I could not imagine anyone using this for gaming as it would surely die before the game is finished.So my options now were to either leave the keyboard plugged in, which defeats the purpose of buying a wireless keyboard (and deal with the weird random letters and opening of other applications); or turning the light effects off to save battery life, which defeats the purpose of buying an expensive RGB keyboard.Either way, I would not get what I paid a lot of money for.So, I am returning the keyboard.",true,1,6,"15","B08FQTK1RW","corsair k63",true,179.99,"USD",229.99,50,21.74,682,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FQTK1RW","2932.60",false,false,false,false,"Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro Mechanical Wireless Gaming Keyboard: Green Mechanical Switches - Tactile & Clicky - Chroma RGB Lig...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RyDhL6FjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R29NH6RU20KFL7","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2021",1,"Stopped Connecting to Anything After Just 2 Months of Use","I got this keyboard to replace a Huntsman optical that overall was doing great, but I had an issue with the volume knob (which I use quite regularly) and for me it wasn't the best tying experience for working and gaming. I needed a keyboard that was a little more clicky as I was accidentally hitting other keys with the very short travel of the Huntsman optical. I also wanted wireless so I could pair my work laptop via bluetooth and either connect via a cable or dongle with my personal computer.The Blackwidow V3 Pro at first was amazing. Connected quickly and reliably, the typing experience was much better for my work, the volume knob worked great unlike my Huntsman optical, and the RGB matched perfectly with my other peripherals, and I was in heaven.Then the 2-3 key presses started happening. This wasn't something I noticed with a lot of reviews when I purchased this, but looking back this is a huge problem with this keyboard. This is very problematic depending on what type of game you're playing or if you're pulling double duty and using this keyboard for work. Constantly editing emails or documents was getting very old.I also ran into connection issues after just a month. At first it was just not connecting to bluetooth as quickly, but then if I was using the 2.4Ghz dongle on my personal rig during a game, it would just cut out. It was 3 feet away and within perfect line of sight. Then it got so bad I had to just start plugging it in to game because of random disconnects. It also started randomly flashing the lights.Then today it just stopped connecting to anything. Won't connect to bluetooth, the 2.4ghz dongle or a wired connection. It won't pair with anything new but I was able to reset it and then update the firmware. Then it registers with Synapse if I have it plugged in, but it is still not usable at all. No key presses will register. Also if I press keys while it's connected via the USB cord, it will do random colors like rainbow wave, or do green pulse from where I push the key. The keyboard is entirely useless now after just 2 months.Do not buy this keyboard, or if you do, get a warranty. This is the 2nd Razer keyboard in a row that's had problem. I've typically loved the feel of Razer products, but $500 of peripherals that have either had issues or bit the dust in 2 years is too much.

"R161YJG97KZXE7","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",3,"Much dimmer key light and lightweight/flimsy feel compared to my mechanical keyboard","I bought this to replace a backlit, but non-RGB tenkeyless mechanical keyboard with this one. My initial reactions were that the spacebar was WAY WAY WAY too loud, the keyboard tactile feedback felt cheap and hollow, and that the backlight was only about half as bright as my non-RGB backlit keyboard.I searched on youtube and found a lot of people who had felt the same way about the loud spacebar sound. I even watched some videos where people had put keyboard o-rings on and reported NO DIFFERENCE. I watched a video where someone put TWO sets of o-rings on the keys and reported NO DIFFERENCE.So... I ordered a set of 40A and 80A orings, and put the 40A on first, then the 80A, and after doing that, I felt that the tactile feedback seemed good and the spacebar sound was acceptably dampened.At this point, I replaced my MAX Blackbird Tenkeyless with my quieted Razer Huntsman. My initial reaction was that the MAX Blackbird is WAY more durable and substantial, and that while RGB is fun, the backlighting on the MAX Blackbird was literally about twice as bright. I debated for a long time about just putting this keyboard in my parts box and keep using my old keyboard.But, I'd already invested the time and since having RGB keyboard/mouse/mouse pad had been so important to me for some intangible reason, I stuck with it.Aside from the flimsier keycaps, and noisy keys, the opto-mechanical switches are REALLY FAST and I have no complaints about this keyboard for gaming. The downside of this to me is that I'm finding that I'm making a LOT more typing errors with this keyboard as the keys are much more sensitive (too sensitive?), but I'm adapting.I just wish there were a higher end Razer tenkeyless keyboard that felt more substantial, had twice the brightness, and had a purchase option for pudding keycaps (since you can't find a set that 100% fits this keyboard).",true,1,11,"110","B07V25YPVW","corsair k63",true,99.99,"USD",129.99,30,23.08,4111,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V25YPVW","18910.60",false,false,false,false,"Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition TKL Tenkeyless Gaming Keyboard: Fastest Keyboard Switches Ever - Linear Optical Switches...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ikKpHAlBL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R3O5SANQGECKBI","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2021",1,"Wireless doesn't work. Horrible layout. Shady company.","First thing to know is that the Bluetooth functionality with this keyboard is 100% broken and will not work for any length of time. When it does, the keyboard enters sleep mode with no actual way to turn it off, regardless of what their software or firmware updates claim to have fixed. After a replacement and several firmware upgrades over the year and a half it rarely, if ever, connects wirelessly, and when it does, the battery lasts an hour tops. Since this is advertised as a Bluetooth keyboard I'd call this listing borderline fraudulent.The layout choice is also horrible - question mark key placement is idiosyncratic to this keyboard so you have to retrain your muscle memory.

"R1FRW9RUUQ0DB1","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",2,"Great initially, but not built to last","I bought this keyboard in November of 2018. I am a casual gamer, and I really enjoyed the bright colors and the Cherry MX Speed keys. I have never had a keyboard with dedicated macro keys before, and the keyboard itself seemed quite sturdy.Fast-forward to today, and I am having some annoying difficulties with this keyboard that others have noted in the reviews. It does not happen every time, but often when I try to type an ""A"" it ends up writing ""AA"" or ""AAA"". It does not happen every time I press the button either, which only makes it more annoying. As another reviewer noted, this seems to be due to using WASD keys more than the others.In addition, I find that the spacebar is difficult to use in some games. Unless I perfectly hit it in the middle on every press, it will over time begin to slope downward to the left (when my left hand is on WASD my thumb naturally falls just left of the center of the spacebar). This eventually results in the spacebar not registering all of my presses until I press down on the right side and get it back to level.Lastly, switching between users on my computer often causes the keyboard software to glitch and refuse to work until I unplug the USB and plug it back in.None of these issues seem like major concerns, but I bought this keyboard thinking that it would last longer than 3 years.

"R5MY12VKEAJE2","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021",2,"Ok at first, but the keys break quickly","I really like this keyboard at first, I was a little concerned with how loud the keys were and if they would be disruptive on a conference call, but people said they couldn’t really hear them. My major problem with this keyboard is the keys start to break.The plastic that makes up the cross pattern that connects the key to the keyboard seems to be very weak. Within about 2 months or so of owning it, the left side control key broke. To Corsairs credit they sent me a replacement key very quickly, but a few months after that the right control key started to come loose.What I have noticed is it is the keys that are around the edge of the keyboard that have the issue. What I believe it to be is it is the keys that you aren’t pressing at a straight up and down, it is the keys that you are reaching over to with your pinky fingers that are really the problem. I have a feeling overtime they would all start to break down, but the ones that are getting more pressure at an angle are just breaking first.Long story short, I replacing this and going back to my trusted Logitech keyboard because, while their customer service was great, I can’t be waiting for replacement keys every couple months.If this is primarily used for gaming and not a combination of day-to-day and gaming I would say it will last you a while, but if you’re thinking about getting this for your day-to-day I wouldn’t recommend it.",true,1,6,"15","B01MS0I1ZK","corsair k68",false,198.99,"USD",0,0,0,5028,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MS0I1ZK","23128.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard -6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Tac...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71niQiKL9lL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Had a few issues reinstalling and getting everything working the 2nd time.The biggest annoyance (at least its something small) is the volume buttons on top right to mute, lower or raise the volume will just stop working. ill restart icue but that wont work. The only way to fix this is either A: restarting the computer sometimes fixes it. B: Go to settings in Icue and force update the firmware. even though you are currently on that firmware you have to force update it so it starts working again. While this is a rather simple fix.

There are so many better options for your keyboard!","This BEST part of Corsair's newest generation of keyboards is they now use a standard bottom row. This means that you can put almost any keycap set you want on your fancy new keyboard and really make it your own one of a kind keyboard. You are no longer beholden to Corsair's proprietary first party keycap sets. Which is a good thing because these Corsair key caps kind of suck.I've posted some pictures of my K65 keyboard to show what I mean. You can see that the light bleed on these keycaps is just terrible. The red keys in the picture are corsair and the white and blue keycaps are from a third party (drop, I think). On the red switches the entire area around the lettering glows meaning that they are thin in that area. The white switches the only theletter lights up more without the bleed. This is especially true with higher brightness levels and colors closer to white. On the red keycaps when the RGB is set to pure white the color comes through as a deeper pink. The same could be said of the blue third party caps, but it's not nearly as bad.On the upside these keycaps feel good and will fit just about any keyboard, but you can spend the same money and get a much better keycap from places like Drop, Ducky, HyperX or just about anywhere else.Do yourself a favor- look elsewhere.",true,1,12,"111","B0919KTK2B","corsair k68",false,29.99,"USD",0,0,0,926,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0919KTK2B","4259.60",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR PBT Double-Shot PRO Keycap Mod Kit – Double-Shot PBT Keycaps – Onyx Black – Standard Bottom Row – Textured Surface...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ex2gQlCbS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R16PULKI4RZGT0","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2021",5,"Finally, a low-profile mechanical!","I haven't tried many mechanical keyboard before this one, but they always felt too tall and chunky to me. I grew too accustomed to laptop keyboards in the mid 2000's, and then had a low-profile membrane gaming keyboard (Microsoft Sidewinder) for many years, and like that form factor. When I saw that Corsair, a brand I trust and whose mice I already adore, made a low profile mechanical board, I wanted to try it out. And it didn't disappoint! Love the mechanical feel, which is more stable and linear than the slightly wobbly keys of my old membrane board, without feeling uncomfortably tall like most standard mechanical boards feel to me.All the other features are awesome, too. The iCue software makes customizing the RGB super fun. You can program each key individually with dozens of patterns, in literally any color you can imagine. Corsair really has the best RGB ecosystem. On top of that, the USB passthrough is handy, and the media controls are super convenient. Also, the profile switch button makes it easy to change lighting on the fly, and since my computer lives near my bed, makes it easy to put my whole computer in ""stealth mode"" by switching to a profile that turns all the RGB off so it doesn't keep me up at night while my gaming rig passively mines crypto to help recoup the cost of building it.All in all, a solid 9.5/10.

"R2PC0IIPIZJ45C","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021",1,"Great Keyboard, Poor Lighting Quality","Update: I haven't even had the replacement keyboard a week and the escape key just flat out doesn't work. Do not buy this keyboard, it is pure junk.I really like the way this keyboard feels to type on. The low profile keys are nice, the switches are pretty quiet overall, and it feels very responsive. From a day to day use standpoint, I have absolutely zero complaints about this product. However, one of the reasons to buy a keyboard like this one is the lightning and that's where my issues begin.First, I am very, very lucky if iCUE, Corsair's peripheral management software, recognizes this keyboard, which means it's almost always either on the default rainbow state or stuck on one color (I have it set to rotate between three colors normally to match the lighting on my tower), plus I can't manage any of the keys or use custom keybinds. Often iCUE will even see the keyboard is connected but still won't let me manage it. This is remedied if I unplug it and plug it back in several times; basically, it will eventually always recognize it, but it's a question of how long I have to fidget with it and then a roll of the dice on how long it'll stay connected.Second, when it actually IS working with iCUE, typing on it causes the keys to randomly flash white on keystroke, which is definitely not a thing it should be doing. It's very distracting when every third or fourth keystroke causes the whole keyboard to be briefly bright white. This only happens when the keyboard's iCUE profile is actually working, though, so basically I am stuck with a situation where if the software doesn't see it, it doesn't work right, and if the software sees it, it doesn't work right in a completely different way.I sent the first of these back assuming it was a defect and the second one has all the exact same problems, so my suggestion would be to look elsewhere; I am sure you can get cheaper keyboards with similar keys and skip the lighting problems.",true,1,19,"118","B07H6MWLXS","corsair k68",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,457,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6MWLXS","2147.90",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 Low Profile Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - Linear & Quiet, Backlit RGB LED, Cherry MX Low Profile Red","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zMyzhd6WL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

This is not a knock against them, as every other product of theirs I've bought (which is many) has served me well, but the G610 was failing earlier than expected. So I needed a new keyboard.Every Corsair product I've ever bought significantly exceeded my expectations. This naturally causes my expectations to rise still further, and this keyboard still beat them. The Cherry Speed switches are quieter than what my last keyboard had, which I love. The required pressing force and travel to actuate them are quite light, which is great for extended use to prevent finger fatigue. Just make sure you're able to only hit the keys you want to press. Accidental actuation is possible.It's noticeably narrower than my G610. I've reclaimed about 3 inches of width on my desk. The spacebar is textured for some reason, but it's fine with me. So is the removable wrist rest, which makes a little more sense. There are 3 brightness settings, plus off. The brightest should be easily visible unless you're standing in direct sunlight at midday. The dimmest won't be irritating in a darkened room.It has a USB pass-through, which requires plugging in a second cable. This is optional and the keyboard will work just fine with only the one cable plugged in (make sure it's the right one; they are labeled).

Just resting my fingers on the keys will cause unintended activations - which caused me endless typos when typing and problems in games, doing things I had no intention to do.This may be different for you, as I am used to Logitech keyboards with tactile keys and low travel, where you have to push the key past the tactile ""hump"" before you get any activation.So if you are used to non-tactile cherry switches, you can disregard that part of my review.It was surprising to me, to have keys with quite more travel than I'm used to, but that would activate at the very top position.I assume some gamers want just that, so they have faster activations.For me, that was catastrophic and I returned this and ordered another Logitech keyboard - also designed for gaming, but with tactile + clicky keys.I would have gone for just tactile, but those were sold out... ah well:)Hopefully this helps someone who might otherwise end up with the wrong keyboard...Note, that low profile switches that are also tactile seem to be unavailable from Cherry!I give 4 stars, because keys are a personal choice and what doesn't work for me might work for you.",true,1,3,"12","B07H6LBQ62","corsair k70",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,676,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6LBQ62","3177.20",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR K70 RGB MK.2 RAPIDFIRE Low Profile - Backlit RGB LED - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Fastest & Linear Low Pro...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716-o5oFSjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R16PULKI4RZGT0","Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2021",5,"Finally, a low-profile mechanical!","I haven't tried many mechanical keyboard before this one, but they always felt too tall and chunky to me. I grew too accustomed to laptop keyboards in the mid 2000's, and then had a low-profile membrane gaming keyboard (Microsoft Sidewinder) for many years, and like that form factor. When I saw that Corsair, a brand I trust and whose mice I already adore, made a low profile mechanical board, I wanted to try it out. And it didn't disappoint! Love the mechanical feel, which is more stable and linear than the slightly wobbly keys of my old membrane board, without feeling uncomfortably tall like most standard mechanical boards feel to me.All the other features are awesome, too. The iCue software makes customizing the RGB super fun. You can program each key individually with dozens of patterns, in literally any color you can imagine. Corsair really has the best RGB ecosystem. On top of that, the USB passthrough is handy, and the media controls are super convenient. Also, the profile switch button makes it easy to change lighting on the fly, and since my computer lives near my bed, makes it easy to put my whole computer in ""stealth mode"" by switching to a profile that turns all the RGB off so it doesn't keep me up at night while my gaming rig passively mines crypto to help recoup the cost of building it.All in all, a solid 9.5/10.

"R2PC0IIPIZJ45C","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021",1,"Great Keyboard, Poor Lighting Quality","Update: I haven't even had the replacement keyboard a week and the escape key just flat out doesn't work. Do not buy this keyboard, it is pure junk.I really like the way this keyboard feels to type on. The low profile keys are nice, the switches are pretty quiet overall, and it feels very responsive. From a day to day use standpoint, I have absolutely zero complaints about this product. However, one of the reasons to buy a keyboard like this one is the lightning and that's where my issues begin.First, I am very, very lucky if iCUE, Corsair's peripheral management software, recognizes this keyboard, which means it's almost always either on the default rainbow state or stuck on one color (I have it set to rotate between three colors normally to match the lighting on my tower), plus I can't manage any of the keys or use custom keybinds. Often iCUE will even see the keyboard is connected but still won't let me manage it. This is remedied if I unplug it and plug it back in several times; basically, it will eventually always recognize it, but it's a question of how long I have to fidget with it and then a roll of the dice on how long it'll stay connected.Second, when it actually IS working with iCUE, typing on it causes the keys to randomly flash white on keystroke, which is definitely not a thing it should be doing. It's very distracting when every third or fourth keystroke causes the whole keyboard to be briefly bright white. This only happens when the keyboard's iCUE profile is actually working, though, so basically I am stuck with a situation where if the software doesn't see it, it doesn't work right, and if the software sees it, it doesn't work right in a completely different way.I sent the first of these back assuming it was a defect and the second one has all the exact same problems, so my suggestion would be to look elsewhere; I am sure you can get cheaper keyboards with similar keys and skip the lighting problems.",true,1,4,"13","B07H6MWLXS","corsair k70",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,457,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6MWLXS","2147.90",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 Low Profile Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - Linear & Quiet, Backlit RGB LED, Cherry MX Low Profile Red","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zMyzhd6WL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I guess my only complaint is the top, side, andbuttons and the right mouse button. You see, I usually swing my arm over at the mouse and often hit the side buttons. I just wish they were a bit more firm. The way I put my hand on the mouse, I often hold the right mouse button from the side and it feels ""sticky"" because it hangs off the side a bit too much.It works well with the Corsair iCue software and looks great. I especially like that you can control the whole setup from the mouse. The top two buttons switch between themes in the software so you can set profiles and cycle between them if you have RGB LED's in your rig like I do. Again, I wish they were more firm, because I keep hitting them and then my whole PC goes dark because I only have the one profile (for now). I just wish the keyboard didn't come damaged.The 6, Y. H, and B keys were all DOA. I assume they are connected in some way. The LED's lit up real nicely though. One of the keys also looked pressed in a bit. Perhaps that had something to do with it? It's very frustrating because I had problems with the motherboard and GPU as well. I'm probably not going to buy computer parts on Amazon anymore.

"R2UBBP9NRQ5PXK","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2021",5,"Perfect replacement for my Logitech G610","I had a Logitech keyboard last. This is not a knock against them, as every other product of theirs I've bought (which is many) has served me well, but the G610 was failing earlier than expected. So I needed a new keyboard.Every Corsair product I've ever bought significantly exceeded my expectations. This naturally causes my expectations to rise still further, and this keyboard still beat them. The Cherry Speed switches are quieter than what my last keyboard had, which I love. The required pressing force and travel to actuate them are quite light, which is great for extended use to prevent finger fatigue. Just make sure you're able to only hit the keys you want to press. Accidental actuation is possible.It's noticeably narrower than my G610. I've reclaimed about 3 inches of width on my desk. The spacebar is textured for some reason, but it's fine with me. So is the removable wrist rest, which makes a little more sense. There are 3 brightness settings, plus off. The brightest should be easily visible unless you're standing in direct sunlight at midday. The dimmest won't be irritating in a darkened room.It has a USB pass-through, which requires plugging in a second cable. This is optional and the keyboard will work just fine with only the one cable plugged in (make sure it's the right one; they are labeled). It comes with several replacement keys, and a tool to help replace keys.I did not want to spend $200 on their newest flagship board. I think this was wise; I could not imagine the additional cost being worth it, when this board is so good.",true,1,10,"19","B07D5S54C6","corsair k70",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,7114,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D5S54C6","33435.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Linear & Quiet - Cherry MX Red - RGB ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71eARwGvFaL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

But this maybe a con for someone else.I have seen this issue on many other reviews and I have the same major issue.

Then about a week ago, an issue started where I'd hit the ""r"" key and would repeat two or three times with only a single press. After reaching out for help, they explained it may need cleaned. I do not eat anything near my keyboard and have never spilled anything on my desk, so figured this was unlikely but decided to try anyway. I pulled the key off, saw nothing on the board nor within the key itself, used canned air just in case, put it back together, and the same issue.If cleaning didn't work, the second option was to force the keyboard into ""CRP_Disabled"" drive and sent me files to replace the firmware.bin. Since I tried this, following their instructions step-by-step, my keyboard no longer works at all. No lights, no response, nothing. I tried different USB ports, reset my computer, tried a different computer, nothing. I can get it back to the ""DRP_Disabled"" drive but that's it.Not happy.

"R2UOTYDJWTAWF3","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",5,"Excellent headset and versatility, but subpar software","I want to preface this by saying I've had this headset for a year and a half and has held up well through the somewhat torture I've given it! Keep in mind I use this headset anywhere from 10-25 hours a week so if that gives you any idea as to how much I've used these, do with that as you will. Anyways here's a pros and cons list to simplify it with a summary to recap my thoughts on this headset.Pros:-The versatility of these headphones is great mainly because you can plug them into your pc or console, charge them and keep playing or just use them while plugged in, AND connect them to your phone with an aux cord if you wanna walk around with them and blast music.-The sound quality is phenomenal with highs being crisp and lows being bassy and the mids filling the gaps to make a smoothsound or listening to music a joy. The sound isolation is great as you can hear the footsteps of someone below, above, behind. It makes a very immersive experience as it can turn a roar from a zombie around the corner go from ""ehh"", to ""holy hell what was that, and where did it come from"" experience. Not always obviously, but I've never gotten an experience like this from any other headset.-They look great, and have held up well even though I can be a bit rough with them from time to time.-When Icue works the customization for the EQ is impressive and enhances the experience if done right. Though careful, with a custom EQ, because if you push it too high or low you could have distortion issues. Something to be aware of as I feel this is more of a software issue rather than the headsets ability to produce the desired sound you want.-Mic quality is superb wireless and connected. I've never had anyone have problems with my mic quality being poor or choppy. Only time there's issues with this is either some software, program, or internet issues and not the mic itself.Cons:-Not a surprise but the cost is up there, but honestly I've gotten my money's worth and they keep going strong after a year and a half so it's a con, but small at this point.-The ear cups are not made to last. I did have to replace the ear cups after about 6 months of regular use, and it wasn't the most comfortable tbh, but I found bigger/better replacement Earcups from a 3rd party that were more much comfortable and have held up better (I have a big head and ears so this was a great find) at the cost of loss to noise canceling it is ""supposed"" to have.-Battery life on these are pretty good, but not 20 hours as they advertise. Even when they were brand new I was getting MAYBE 14-16 hours if conditions were perfect, but not 20. This being said the LI-Ion battery still gets me a solid 10 hours on a full charge and the recharge is quick so I can just throw the cable on to charge while staying in ""wireless"" mode and then 30min have passed and it's back to green again so it's a con for not completely accurate advertising, but not terrible battery life by any stretch. Just unrealistic.Cons unrelated to the headset itself, but corsairs software issues:-RGB... Idk WHY, when you turn on the headset, the mic goes RGB and shows the rainbow, but then you can not customize the mic color at all. WHY show that off and then not come through. Solid miss there.-until recently I HATED ICue but I had no choice but to use it for my headset, but with some recent updates it's gotten better. Less buggy and more dependable, but when my headset acts up I usually look at ICue first to make sure it isn't the, poor excuse for, software causing the issue.-ICue is just a very subpar app and honestly needs some major work. Idk why it's as buggy as it is because this headset deserved better than this. I won't drag the rating down because of something the app does wrong where as the headset itself is pretty dang great.-I'm lumping this in the software issue seeing as it's controlled through Icue is the 7.1 surround sound is not phenomenal. It's pretty good in some games that have surround sound features enabled, but for movies, shows, music ect. It's not great as it sometimes cuts out the mids HARD to the point where sometimes an explosion sounds muffled or just wonky for a lack of a better term. Also the higher frequencies tend to get swollowed up during bassier sequences in whatever it is so it leaves it feeling hollow in many scenes. My advice is stick with the stereo setting as it does a pretty great job of sounding equal and correct in any setting rather than hit or miss with everything. Nifty idea that fell flat imo.-voice prompts... Just... Don't use that setting...Finally the...Summary:Overall I maybe leaving a few things out, but most of the cons on the headset itself are little or not a deal breaker (atleast for me), but things to think on how to improve the virtuoso descendants going forward. I personally love the headset itself and there's more I could say, but at this point you'll have based most of your decision on what I said earlier if you even made it this far lol. My biggest gripes are the ICue software we're forced to deal with as it maybe ""esthetically"" pleasing to look at. It's a far cry from great, or even good. As it stands now it works mostly, but the bugs drive me insane. The lack of thought to letting people mess with the mics light colors is what lends me to believe it's lazy or just cheap to not let people do what they want which is just rediculous to me. I digress from this bit of rage here. In all a great headset itself, but poor software to harness all of the greatness.Headset - 9/10 few fixes/adjustments and it would probably be perfectSoftware (Icue) - was 3 - now after many updates later 6/10. If they could focus on a great customer experience and fix the bugs rather than just cheap implementation of features or lack there of for that matter, and some which haven't changed. This would be a much better experience.",true,1,16,"115","B07VTGSC3B","corsair k70",true,169.24,"USD",179.99,10.75,5.97,5974,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VTGSC3B","25688.20",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Virtuoso RGB Wireless Gaming Headset - High-Fidelity 7.1 Surround Sound w/Broadcast Quality Microph...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61A34gN0jfL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Sometimes it just maxes out randomly which can be infuriating and downright absurd when you're playing a game and require listening to sounds.In terms of tactile feel, this keyboard has been performing great for me for a while.

"R2VFD4UMJRT09D","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2021",5,"It's expensive for a reason.","This is the first ""super high end"" keyboard I've bought.I laughed at the thought of spending more than $100 on a keyboard.However, my old one was having issues and I needed a new one.During my review searching, I kept seeing BlackWidow Elite mentioned. It showed up more than a few times.I checked it out and was like ""No! I'm not paying almost $200 for that!"" then I kept reading. And it showed up a lot.After doing tons of searching through Amazon, I ended up coming back to this one and doing more research. I was intrigued. I started looking for specific reviews about this keyboard. YouTube. Reddit. Amazon. And more...This keyboard has a lot going for it.It's surprising how many bells and whistles this comes with. Each individual key light can be controlled in some manner.The app for it (call Synapse...kind of like in the movie Antitrust) has tons of presets. And there's an entire community of people who make color themes for this. I love it. Someone is always coming up with something new and interesting.The app lets you set up macros and key binds for almost anything. And there's a bunch of other stuff I haven't even messed with.Synapse could use some QOL improvements and some upgrades. The layout design could use some love and navigating the app takes some getting used to. It's not horrible but there is definitely room for improvement. For what it is right now, it's a good app. I don't hate it.What I don't like is that the keyboard immediately prompts you to install Synapse as soon as you plug it in. I'm sure there are some people who want to use the keyboard as just a mechanical keyboard and they don't want to use the app. I'm not sure if this is an option for them, but it should be. A $200 keyboard should not force a software installation to be used.As I have not tried using my keyboard without Synapse, I can't expound on this topic other than to say the popup might be construed as ""invasive"" to some users.Another small thing I really like about the keyboard is the side USB plug. It's great for doing quick USB connecting and it's within arms reach at all times.I have USB 3.0 hub that I'm going to try connecting to it at some point to give me some additional ports.You also get a plug for audio in and audio out. I don't use these ports so they have no real effect on me and I can't comment on how the sound quality is. But I'm sure there are others who will love the quick audio port access. Especially if you have a tower that doesn't have easily accessible ports.Let's talk about the additional buttons that come with this. The ones not part of the standard 104.In the upper right corner, this keyboard comes with a spinner dial for controlling volume and a rather large mute button in the center of the dial. To the left of the dial are three media buttons. Rewind, play, and forward (in that order).Now, I like having media buttons. But I LOVE these things because, as a scripter, I can reassign these to do a multitude of things.Example: In my main script that I have running at all times, I wrote a piece of code that lets the dial control the main system volume normally but when the Windows key is held, the volume dial adjusts the sound of Winamp without me having to actually open Winamp (Winamp is a music player that has been around forever. I've used it for years and haven't found a better replacement for it.)On a side note, if you're curious about rebinding keys, making advanced custom macros, and more, check out the language AutoHotkey. It's completely free, it's one of the most user-friendly programming languages I know of, and the community loves teaching newcomers how to create programs. They have a very active main forum, subreddit, and Discord.Back to the review.Finally, I want to talk about the key switches. The Razer greens exceeded my expectations. I've been using this keyboard for long enough that I can comfortably say these keys are probably the best ones I've used.Before this, I had Cherry MX Blues and I loved those. But these greens seem like they're just a smidge better. They're really responsive. The pressure requirement per keypress is great. And I love the ""clack"" they make.There's something almost soothing and zen-like about listening to a keyboard talk as you create something.I do all the major things keyboards are used for: Gaming, coding, and composition.For gaming, it's all about response time and key pressure. The greens have been fantastic in both areas! I've set multiple new records on StepMania (think DDR for your fingers) using this keyboard. The switches seem to be so accurate that I'm hitting notes, rolls, and crossovers that I was having difficulties hitting before. I have a folder of favorite songs and I've gone up 1-2 grades on almost every song in there. Not only that, there are certain songs I had never finished that I've gotten past with this keyboard. I highly doubt that my skill level randomly jumped that much after getting this keyboard. Gotta give props where props are due.For coding and composition, all I care about is not missing keystrokes. Give me what I type.If I'm coding and I miss one letter/number, it can have a myriad of negative effects. It could be an easy error to find or it might be something so unnoticeable that it takes you forever to fix. Either way, I've never had an issue with keystrokes registering when I'm typing. And because the keyboard doesn't have a super high actuation rate, I don't get fatigued fingers after elongated sessions.Finally, I have never experienced any ghosting issues (that's where your keys don't register when you hold too many at once). Apparently, this keyboard has a 10-key rollover with anti-ghosting. I play a ton of different games and not ONCE have I had an issue where multiple keys were being held and some weren't registering. I've also noticed that comments like ""BULLS#@T!!! I did too hit that button!!"" have become almost non-existent. I couldn't be happier about that.TLDR: The BlackWidow Elite is a solid keyboard, it has great features, the Razer greens are some of the best switches I've ever used, the Synapse app is decent and has a lot of options, side ports are very convenient, the extra media buttons are always welcome, and it never ghosts or miss keystrokes.10/10 would buy again.*Authentic Greg Review*Thanks for reading this review.

"R1FRW9RUUQ0DB1","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",2,"Great initially, but not built to last","I bought this keyboard in November of 2018. I am a casual gamer, and I really enjoyed the bright colors and the Cherry MX Speed keys. I have never had a keyboard with dedicated macro keys before, and the keyboard itself seemed quite sturdy.Fast-forward to today, and I am having some annoying difficulties with this keyboard that others have noted in the reviews. It does not happen every time, but often when I try to type an ""A"" it ends up writing ""AA"" or ""AAA"". It does not happen every time I press the button either, which only makes it more annoying. As another reviewer noted, this seems to be due to using WASD keys more than the others.In addition, I find that the spacebar is difficult to use in some games. Unless I perfectly hit it in the middle on every press, it will over time begin to slope downward to the left (when my left hand is on WASD my thumb naturally falls just left of the center of the spacebar). This eventually results in the spacebar not registering all of my presses until I press down on the right side and get it back to level.Lastly, switching between users on my computer often causes the keyboard software to glitch and refuse to work until I unplug the USB and plug it back in.None of these issues seem like major concerns, but I bought this keyboard thinking that it would last longer than 3 years.

"R5MY12VKEAJE2","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021",2,"Ok at first, but the keys break quickly","I really like this keyboard at first, I was a little concerned with how loud the keys were and if they would be disruptive on a conference call, but people said they couldn’t really hear them. My major problem with this keyboard is the keys start to break.The plastic that makes up the cross pattern that connects the key to the keyboard seems to be very weak. Within about 2 months or so of owning it, the left side control key broke. To Corsairs credit they sent me a replacement key very quickly, but a few months after that the right control key started to come loose.What I have noticed is it is the keys that are around the edge of the keyboard that have the issue. What I believe it to be is it is the keys that you aren’t pressing at a straight up and down, it is the keys that you are reaching over to with your pinky fingers that are really the problem. I have a feeling overtime they would all start to break down, but the ones that are getting more pressure at an angle are just breaking first.Long story short, I replacing this and going back to my trusted Logitech keyboard because, while their customer service was great, I can’t be waiting for replacement keys every couple months.If this is primarily used for gaming and not a combination of day-to-day and gaming I would say it will last you a while, but if you’re thinking about getting this for your day-to-day I wouldn’t recommend it.",true,1,19,"118","B01MS0I1ZK","corsair k70",false,198.99,"USD",0,0,0,5028,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MS0I1ZK","23128.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard -6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Tac...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71niQiKL9lL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I use it for intense MMO gaming and it provides everything I require. It is a bit loud but expected for this type of keyboard. the keys off to the left to create macros. I've never created any before this and use the Icue system it was realitivly easy to figure out but there was a slight learning curve through guess and check but got everything working the way i wanted. Lightning is great and customizable. easy to switch it up or just cut it off.Now for the errors. seems to be few. Had to uninstall and reinstall the icue system because it got corrupted two times during my use somehow. Had a few issues reinstalling and getting everything working the 2nd time.The biggest annoyance (at least its something small) is the volume buttons on top right to mute, lower or raise the volume will just stop working. ill restart icue but that wont work. The only way to fix this is either A: restarting the computer sometimes fixes it. B: Go to settings in Icue and force update the firmware. even though you are currently on that firmware you have to force update it so it starts working again. While this is a rather simple fix.

"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,1,"10","B07QX9C9WH","corsair katar",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,6,"15","B07QX9C9WH","corsair katar",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I figured I was just unlucky and grabbed another because I really like the design of the mouse and how it feels in my hand. However, I am already having issues with this mouse giving the double click issue as well, this time with the right mouse button. I've had this one for even less time than the previous. For something that costs 80 dollars this really isn't acceptable and I will be switching to a different brand for my next one.Also, iCue is the worst software package I have ever used, and is basically required to get any sort of functionality out of the mmo buttons on the side.The Logitech mmo mouse (G600) while not looking nearly as attractive lasted me for about 5 years before I finally gave it to a friend after picking up my first Scimitar. He's still using that mouse. It also comes in at half the price and has a ""better"" software setup. Not that Logi's is amazing either, but it's far better than iCue. Personally, I will probably pick up another of these because I'd rather have something that lasts than something that looks nice and fails in such a short time period.https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Gaming-Backlit-Programmable-Buttons/dp/B0086UK7IQ/",true,1,9,"18","B01MU3DZYN","corsair katar",false,79.7,"USD",0,0,0,2285,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU3DZYN","10054.00",false,false,false,false,"Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB - MMO Gaming Mouse - 16,000 DPI Optical Sensor - 12 Programmable Side Buttons - Black","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S4llvgPZL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Going to likely and painfully return this horrible product especially after hearing this happen to others.Edit: this product is the most frustrating experience, nothing lights up properly and customer service told me I had to play email tag because their “tech support” doesn’t cover troubleshooting this and the people that do only answer by email. Sometimes 2 fans light up, other times just one but never all 3 and nothing else in the kit has ever lit up as intended. Stay away.This product comes in great packaging and you really feel like you got value for money especially when you tally up the individual items.It’s also not the cheapest, but I wanted to get something higher quality being my first time and all, but this wasn’t quite the case.To begin I learned the pipes were called something that’s just a fancy word for acrylic, and I learned very fast that it’s not very forgiving and easy to mess up. Couple that with the types of adapters you get which pretty much commit you to hardline tubing and you are stuck either with attempting to use them (and in my case immediately messing up a tube despite watching videos prior,) or investing a lot more money to get better tubes or different adapters, but it doesn’t end there…It comes with a squeeze container for filling the pump which broke off inside just from using, that was 2 hours of draining and playing rubik’s cube trying to get out, not fun. But it doesn’t end there either…The pump is awkward as heck, if you have it all plugged in the thing doesn’t operate at full power when filling and you are stuck trying to figure out why the tubes aren’t filling, why does it gotta be like that?The directions aren’t the best, and this process was very painful, I got coolant all over my motherboard and cards despite my best intent to cover everything which yes, is part to user error but I also feel the acrylic isn’t the best use and I wish there were more options from Corsair like being able to buy a kit with soft tubing.

The second Harpoon I had came broken in both wheel and Omron switches, so I decided to go back to a Sabre, which I previously abandoned due to it not lasting more than 1.5 years before.Well, I guess I am here to stay, because despite Corsair manufacturing mice to basically die in a year or two, this is so much better than a Harpoon. It has dual DPI axis settings, tons of lighting settings that the other doesn't have including more options for when you are not using iCUE, and of course it can poll up into the 8000Hz range along with much improved ergonomics.Previously, you had to manually kill the iCUE process, instead of exiting normally, to retain lighting, such as no lighting, if you didn't want the iCUE process running at all. You could not exit out of it normally, or your lighting would go right back to brightly lit rainbow default. This is fixed with their ""hardware lighting"" option, except for the three DPI markers, which you still need to kill the process to get back to your normal settings.They really need to include the DPI settings in the hardware lighting option, because some of us do not want Corsair processes running at all, and we want a no lit mouse but with the option at least of having it lit when needed. Of course you can bypass all of this and just get the unlit version I think. But they still need to make a way for the DPI lights to shut off without iCUE on, and without having to use the workaround, which does work fine anyway.From a comfort standpoint, it's also a cut above. In fact, this is probably the most comfortable mouse I have ever used. Everything seems almost perfectly suited to my hands and movements. The mouse itself is quite light but not so that you would get annoyed. It glides extremely well, and there is a calibration setting for glide sensitivity built into iCUE for their better mice. It works, and this is the first time I feel not annoyed by iCUE in ages. It has come a long way, and this mouse makes full use of it.So in reality they have made steps forward in nearly every category here. iCUE is no longer garbage, the mouse functions extremely well, and it is a massive cut above their cheaper options.That about sums it up honestly. Much improved in just about every way. The click area is the same hard plastic with coating that will probably wear away after a year or two of solid use. So keep that in mind as well. These don't last forever.

The expense and headache never end (7 years now). The exception to the rule = Corsair’s XD7 water loop system. I must come out of the shadows with this thing.If you are on a budget = stop reading right now… go to the Financial Aid office and ask for money to support your bad computer habit (cuz you are in trouble dude).Even if this ‘work of art’ fails tomorrow, I will enjoy this moment. I give THANOS credit to the engineering and designers of this pump. It makes perfect sense and saves a lot of space in an EATX case (or perhaps smaller).Along with this unit – the picture shows the Corsair XC7 RGB (CPU cold plate) and the Corsair XG7 RGB (GPU water block / cold plate). And I never thought I would be staring at my own …. for three days without blinking my eyes. (see photo)Tech Specs:> The XG7 (Rev B) is a perfect fit for my EVGA 2080 XC – which is a reference card (meaning NVIDIA gives the reference and EVGA slaps two fans and a shroud over the …..) If your card is bigger than a reference size (10.5 inches long) – then you will likely shed tears finding the correct block (sorry). The problem for many is thickness (like capacitors and extra cooling junk).> The XC7 is a perfect fit for my Intel socket LGA 1200 processor (or any other); Corsair gives you the back plate and spring-loaded screws which can be mounted to where they don’t flop around on install.Advice:Remember: this is just a water pump with pretty lights and outrageous plumbing. The rest is up to you and extensive research. I had to watch several YOUTUBE videos that didn’t teach me nothing about setting up a custom loop (good for reference only or nothing at all). Takes a bit of time…But I know one rule = buy two of everything you can’t find at WALMART or BESTBUY. I needed (12) compression fittings (which come 4 to a box). I needed (2) 90-degree fittings. I did the calculations before I started.

"R1QSI4BJ82MERT","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",5,"Didn't expect would be that good","This is the kind of product you are not sure you really need until you get it and wonder how you could manage to live without it. With all the not so good reviews, especially about the screen, I hesitated for a long time before to buy it but when I got some money as a gift from a aunt I decided to try it.First of all, the device looks very good quality and it sticks very well to my K95. The buttons and widgets are easy to setup with iCUE and you can configure them as you like (color, size, background image, etc.). You can only set 6 buttons per screen but you can set as many screens as you want and it's easy to switch between them by swiping with your finger. I switched from a two monitors setup to a single 32"" one a year ago and I was missing very much to be able to monitor my temperatures while gaming without having to run some overlay programs. Turns out that thing does it wonderfully well.Unlike some other people said I didn't notice any increase of CPU usage after I connected it (but maybe it's because my Ryzen 5900x just doesn't feel it).About the screen, it's true that if you look at it from an angle you don't see anything anymore but... this thing is not supposed to be looked at from a 45 degree angle. It is supposed to be watched when you are in front of your keyboard and when you do that it's amazingly clear and bright. My only negative point is that the touch functionality when you press a button is not always super reactive but I realize that it works fine if you aim more toward the bottom of the screen instead of the top. In that way it works just fine.Overall, it's an expansive device but for me it worth it.

"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,1,"10","B07QX9C9WH","corsair sabre",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R3L8O60668R76I","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2021",5,"A nearly perfect mouse SO FAR.","Mice are something that seem to last about a year. Going into a review, you should not really expect much more than that these days if you are a hardcore user. Bearing that in mind, there are still some huge quality differences between something like this and Corsair's Harpoon.I had a Harpoon, the cheaper version of this mouse, for about a year. It did an okay job. It has less options through iCUE, and in general it's just a lesser mouse in every way. The second Harpoon I had came broken in both wheel and Omron switches, so I decided to go back to a Sabre, which I previously abandoned due to it not lasting more than 1.5 years before.Well, I guess I am here to stay, because despite Corsair manufacturing mice to basically die in a year or two, this is so much better than a Harpoon. It has dual DPI axis settings, tons of lighting settings that the other doesn't have including more options for when you are not using iCUE, and of course it can poll up into the 8000Hz range along with much improved ergonomics.Previously, you had to manually kill the iCUE process, instead of exiting normally, to retain lighting, such as no lighting, if you didn't want the iCUE process running at all. You could not exit out of it normally, or your lighting would go right back to brightly lit rainbow default. This is fixed with their ""hardware lighting"" option, except for the three DPI markers, which you still need to kill the process to get back to your normal settings.They really need to include the DPI settings in the hardware lighting option, because some of us do not want Corsair processes running at all, and we want a no lit mouse but with the option at least of having it lit when needed. Of course you can bypass all of this and just get the unlit version I think. But they still need to make a way for the DPI lights to shut off without iCUE on, and without having to use the workaround, which does work fine anyway.From a comfort standpoint, it's also a cut above. In fact, this is probably the most comfortable mouse I have ever used. Everything seems almost perfectly suited to my hands and movements. The mouse itself is quite light but not so that you would get annoyed. It glides extremely well, and there is a calibration setting for glide sensitivity built into iCUE for their better mice. It works, and this is the first time I feel not annoyed by iCUE in ages. It has come a long way, and this mouse makes full use of it.So in reality they have made steps forward in nearly every category here. iCUE is no longer garbage, the mouse functions extremely well, and it is a massive cut above their cheaper options.That about sums it up honestly. Much improved in just about every way. The click area is the same hard plastic with coating that will probably wear away after a year or two of solid use. So keep that in mind as well. These don't last forever.

"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,11,"110","B07QX9C9WH","corsair sabre",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

So basically theamount of clicks u don’t have to worry about. It’s the plastic that wears and tears. I found myself opening the mouse to see why it wasn’t clicking as well as it use to and it turns out the plastic on the button is just wearing down. Plus it’s very easy to get dirty. So cleaning it helped also and I’m able to use it for a bonus extra 3 weeks. I would buy from the company again but they need to make this one smaller and bluetooth.

The thumb rest keeps your hand on the mouse and off the pad to make for smooth movement and less drag and the ability to change the weight is more valuable than I first assumed.I picked this up on sale and I think the price point is very fair for what you are getting.

I've had a sharkoon mouse since 2014 and now it hurts my fingers to click. So I bought this crosair mouse. I didn't buy it because I'm left handed. I got it because of the two right side buttons. I'm not sure why gaming mouses don't have right side buttons. So basically I got this mouse for the buttons.I play 3 different action MMORPGs with action combat, using mouse clicks for skills.The left side buttons are so faulty and trash. There's friction between my finger and the mouse skills popping off when I click.This mouse was not designed for gaming... The left side buttons are too far forward and flimsy. It does not feel like I'm pressing a button, more like reaching for something unsecured and difficult to push.The clickers need to pressed rather than lightly touched. I find this to be harder to deal with ... Think about slamming your hand flat on a table, this is what it feels like to press the clickers.Something more annoying than the buttons is the failure to load. Sharkoon always loads, crosair does not.I have had to restart computer, unplug and replug, even loaded the ique software. Why? Because the mouse DOES NOT COME ON.. A few times it shut off completely.

"R2UOTYDJWTAWF3","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",5,"Excellent headset and versatility, but subpar software","I want to preface this by saying I've had this headset for a year and a half and has held up well through the somewhat torture I've given it! Keep in mind I use this headset anywhere from 10-25 hours a week so if that gives you any idea as to how much I've used these, do with that as you will. Anyways here's a pros and cons list to simplify it with a summary to recap my thoughts on this headset.Pros:-The versatility of these headphones is great mainly because you can plug them into your pc or console, charge them and keep playing or just use them while plugged in, AND connect them to your phone with an aux cord if you wanna walk around with them and blast music.-The sound quality is phenomenal with highs being crisp and lows being bassy and the mids filling the gaps to make a smoothsound or listening to music a joy. The sound isolation is great as you can hear the footsteps of someone below, above, behind. It makes a very immersive experience as it can turn a roar from a zombie around the corner go from ""ehh"", to ""holy hell what was that, and where did it come from"" experience. Not always obviously, but I've never gotten an experience like this from any other headset.-They look great, and have held up well even though I can be a bit rough with them from time to time.-When Icue works the customization for the EQ is impressive and enhances the experience if done right. Though careful, with a custom EQ, because if you push it too high or low you could have distortion issues. Something to be aware of as I feel this is more of a software issue rather than the headsets ability to produce the desired sound you want.-Mic quality is superb wireless and connected. I've never had anyone have problems with my mic quality being poor or choppy. Only time there's issues with this is either some software, program, or internet issues and not the mic itself.Cons:-Not a surprise but the cost is up there, but honestly I've gotten my money's worth and they keep going strong after a year and a half so it's a con, but small at this point.-The ear cups are not made to last. I did have to replace the ear cups after about 6 months of regular use, and it wasn't the most comfortable tbh, but I found bigger/better replacement Earcups from a 3rd party that were more much comfortable and have held up better (I have a big head and ears so this was a great find) at the cost of loss to noise canceling it is ""supposed"" to have.-Battery life on these are pretty good, but not 20 hours as they advertise. Even when they were brand new I was getting MAYBE 14-16 hours if conditions were perfect, but not 20. This being said the LI-Ion battery still gets me a solid 10 hours on a full charge and the recharge is quick so I can just throw the cable on to charge while staying in ""wireless"" mode and then 30min have passed and it's back to green again so it's a con for not completely accurate advertising, but not terrible battery life by any stretch. Just unrealistic.Cons unrelated to the headset itself, but corsairs software issues:-RGB... Idk WHY, when you turn on the headset, the mic goes RGB and shows the rainbow, but then you can not customize the mic color at all. WHY show that off and then not come through. Solid miss there.-until recently I HATED ICue but I had no choice but to use it for my headset, but with some recent updates it's gotten better. Less buggy and more dependable, but when my headset acts up I usually look at ICue first to make sure it isn't the, poor excuse for, software causing the issue.-ICue is just a very subpar app and honestly needs some major work. Idk why it's as buggy as it is because this headset deserved better than this. I won't drag the rating down because of something the app does wrong where as the headset itself is pretty dang great.-I'm lumping this in the software issue seeing as it's controlled through Icue is the 7.1 surround sound is not phenomenal. It's pretty good in some games that have surround sound features enabled, but for movies, shows, music ect. It's not great as it sometimes cuts out the mids HARD to the point where sometimes an explosion sounds muffled or just wonky for a lack of a better term. Also the higher frequencies tend to get swollowed up during bassier sequences in whatever it is so it leaves it feeling hollow in many scenes.

Esdecir solamente podemos tener una duración óptima de la batería cuando lo usamos con luces apagadas, y eso solo pasa en windows.Si no fuera por la duración de la batería, debe ser el auricular inalámbrico más perfecto que hay, para video llamadas en el trabajo, juegos en red, juegos offline, playstation (xbox, solo con cable), y con un microfono que con una precisión asombrosa.

"R2UOTYDJWTAWF3","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",5,"Excellent headset and versatility, but subpar software","I want to preface this by saying I've had this headset for a year and a half and has held up well through the somewhat torture I've given it! Keep in mind I use this headset anywhere from 10-25 hours a week so if that gives you any idea as to how much I've used these, do with that as you will. Anyways here's a pros and cons list to simplify it with a summary to recap my thoughts on this headset.Pros:-The versatility of these headphones is great mainly because you can plug them into your pc or console, charge them and keep playing or just use them while plugged in, AND connect them to your phone with an aux cord if you wanna walk around with them and blast music.-The sound quality is phenomenal with highs being crisp and lows being bassy and the mids filling the gaps to make a smoothsound or listening to music a joy. The sound isolation is great as you can hear the footsteps of someone below, above, behind. It makes a very immersive experience as it can turn a roar from a zombie around the corner go from ""ehh"", to ""holy hell what was that, and where did it come from"" experience. Not always obviously, but I've never gotten an experience like this from any other headset.-They look great, and have held up well even though I can be a bit rough with them from time to time.-When Icue works the customization for the EQ is impressive and enhances the experience if done right. Though careful, with a custom EQ, because if you push it too high or low you could have distortion issues. Something to be aware of as I feel this is more of a software issue rather than the headsets ability to produce the desired sound you want.-Mic quality is superb wireless and connected. I've never had anyone have problems with my mic quality being poor or choppy. Only time there's issues with this is either some software, program, or internet issues and not the mic itself.Cons:-Not a surprise but the cost is up there, but honestly I've gotten my money's worth and they keep going strong after a year and a half so it's a con, but small at this point.-The ear cups are not made to last. I did have to replace the ear cups after about 6 months of regular use, and it wasn't the most comfortable tbh, but I found bigger/better replacement Earcups from a 3rd party that were more much comfortable and have held up better (I have a big head and ears so this was a great find) at the cost of loss to noise canceling it is ""supposed"" to have.-Battery life on these are pretty good, but not 20 hours as they advertise. Even when they were brand new I was getting MAYBE 14-16 hours if conditions were perfect, but not 20. This being said the LI-Ion battery still gets me a solid 10 hours on a full charge and the recharge is quick so I can just throw the cable on to charge while staying in ""wireless"" mode and then 30min have passed and it's back to green again so it's a con for not completely accurate advertising, but not terrible battery life by any stretch. Just unrealistic.Cons unrelated to the headset itself, but corsairs software issues:-RGB... Idk WHY, when you turn on the headset, the mic goes RGB and shows the rainbow, but then you can not customize the mic color at all. WHY show that off and then not come through. Solid miss there.-until recently I HATED ICue but I had no choice but to use it for my headset, but with some recent updates it's gotten better. Less buggy and more dependable, but when my headset acts up I usually look at ICue first to make sure it isn't the, poor excuse for, software causing the issue.-ICue is just a very subpar app and honestly needs some major work. Idk why it's as buggy as it is because this headset deserved better than this. I won't drag the rating down because of something the app does wrong where as the headset itself is pretty dang great.-I'm lumping this in the software issue seeing as it's controlled through Icue is the 7.1 surround sound is not phenomenal. It's pretty good in some games that have surround sound features enabled, but for movies, shows, music ect. It's not great as it sometimes cuts out the mids HARD to the point where sometimes an explosion sounds muffled or just wonky for a lack of a better term. Also the higher frequencies tend to get swollowed up during bassier sequences in whatever it is so it leaves it feeling hollow in many scenes. My advice is stick with the stereo setting as it does a pretty great job of sounding equal and correct in any setting rather than hit or miss with everything. Nifty idea that fell flat imo.-voice prompts... Just... Don't use that setting...Finally the...Summary:Overall I maybe leaving a few things out, but most of the cons on the headset itself are little or not a deal breaker (atleast for me), but things to think on how to improve the virtuoso descendants going forward.

"R2NJCXPJ9V2VB3","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",3,"Average sound quality, quiet mic, not that comfortable","I bought into all the YouTube reviews hyping this headset. Bought a pair to see for myself and they didn’t meet expectations. Maybe it was due to all the reviews. The material and aesthetics are good and feel premium, but there were too many downsides for me to keep them.Out of the box sound quality is pretty average at best, with weak bass. Note, I never messed with the EQ settings so it's possible this can be fixed with some tweaking. Games might sound fine and if you don’t care about really good sound quality for anything else.Mic quality is actually really solid, but unfortunately really quiet. I’m sure you can increase it with some software, but Corsair should really fix that on their end. The red LED when the mic is in the mute position can get pretty distracting if on a video conference as there is no way to turn it off.For me, it wasn't super comfortable, although you can probably still wear them for long sessions without issues. I have a medium to large head and the strap is enough for me. It feels a bit too heavy and the clamping force is on the strong side.The on/off button has some issues. At times, it seems like the button doesn't register and you have to press and hold a couple of times on the right position. I even got a replacement thinking it was just that headset, but it had the same issue. I could have lived with it, if not for all the other issues.If you really just need a wireless headset with a good mic and are fine with everything else, this could work for you. I really wanted to like them, but for $150, I personally don’t think it’s worth it with all the downsides. If it was priced around $100, I might have kept them.",true,1,9,"19","B09BBPTDWX","corsair virtuoso",false,149.99,"USD",0,0,0,34,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BBPTDWX","136.00",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR HS80 RGB Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with Spatial Audio - Works with Mac, PC, PS5, PS4 - Carbon","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SzBbPQQeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
"R4K5DDTJXA51Z","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",4,"Very impressive!","If I’m being honest, the reviews almost had me running the other direction. I decided to take a leap and give them a shot anyway, and I’m glad I did! I’m a bit of an audiophile and usually rely on a dedicated amp/usb mic/audiophile cans for my gaming needs, but I wanted something wireless that I could also use on my ps5. I’ve tried many other headsets some of which included Jbl Quantum 800s, Steelseries Arctis 7ps, Audeze Penrose, and Beoplay Portals. Although, all of those are good headsets in their own right, something about them that caused me to lose interest and ultimately either return or even sell them for a loss. Generally it was either comfort, connection issues, low volume on console, or poor quality mic that was the leading culprit.Now the HS80s at $150 do everything right while managing to do nothing offensively wrong. They aren’t perfect by any means but what they manage to do at that price point is sound fantastic, have a stable connection, are extremely comfortable, and have the best wireless mic I have ever used. They also work seamlessly on PS5 and get so loud that no person using them would need to go higher than 60%.The only fault I can give these are due to software alone. For people that have used ICUE you already know the issues, but for people that haven’t, it can be particular and require some finesse to get everything working right. One issue I have is every time I turn them on they default to 8 channel audio regardless of them being set to stereo in ICUE. It’s not a huge deal you just go into your sound settings on windows and change it to 2 channel 24 bit 48khz and they sound amazing after that.

The sound is a little richer and cleaner than what I get from my Arctis 7s.The cloth earcups do mean you miss a bit of the bass, but I didn't find the experience lacking since the mids were stronger and helped fill the gap.This headset doesn't offer any 3d audio or surround sound simulations.The microphone was probably the best and worst thing about this headset at the same time.For a wireless headset, the quality of this microphone is ASTOUNDING.I've used a Blue Yeti and AT2020USB as desk microphones in the past and on a purely quality review, this microphone is right there with them for anything but the purest audiophile.Where the microphone suffers is the volume.I'm unsure if my model was defective (due to other concerns below I didn't choose to replace to see and instead did a refund), but even with every mic setting I could find in Windows and the Corsair software maxed out, my friend had to set me to 200% in discord compared to my Arctis 1s or 7s at a normal 100%.If you plan to also use this as a work headset as well, the volume might not be great for zoom or teams calls.I did not test to see how much this microphone could be boosted in OBS capture for streaming.The fit of the headband support is great and the inside adjustments are good if slightly limited, but the earcups were a bit too narrow for me.The memory foam compresses nicely, but when work there was a mild constant pressure against the back of my ears.For normal sitting and gaming it was fine, but since it is wireless, getting up and walking around made it was noticeable for any tiny movements of the headset.Apart from the ears, the overall clamp and fit was perfect though - my Arctis 7 which uses a similar elastic strap system was always too loose for my head and slipped around heavily when walking or bending, but this never seemed at risk of sliding off.",true,1,9,"19","B09BBPTDWX","corsair virtuoso",false,149.99,"USD",0,0,0,34,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BBPTDWX","136.00",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR HS80 RGB Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with Spatial Audio - Works with Mac, PC, PS5, PS4 - Carbon","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SzBbPQQeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

With all the not so good reviews, especially about the screen, I hesitated for a long time before to buy it but when I got some money as a gift from a aunt I decided to try it.First of all, the device looks very good quality and it sticks very well to my K95. The buttons and widgets are easy to setup with iCUE and you can configure them as you like (color, size, background image, etc.). You can only set 6 buttons per screen but you can set as many screens as you want and it's easy to switch between them by swiping with your finger. I switched from a two monitors setup to a single 32"" one a year ago and I was missing very much to be able to monitor my temperatures while gaming without having to run some overlay programs. Turns out that thing does it wonderfully well.Unlike some other people said I didn't notice any increase of CPU usage after I connected it (but maybe it's because my Ryzen 5900x just doesn't feel it).About the screen, it's true that if you look at it from an angle you don't see anything anymore but... this thing is not supposed to be looked at from a 45 degree angle. It is supposed to be watched when you are in front of your keyboard and when you do that it's amazingly clear and bright. My only negative point is that the touch functionality when you press a button is not always super reactive but I realize that it works fine if you aim more toward the bottom of the screen instead of the top. In that way it works just fine.Overall, it's an expansive device but for me it worth it.

The audio is terrible and the noise-cancelling is bad in the sense that I can't hear myself talking enough and it actually makes it difficult to speak. The mic is also a downgrade from its original version. The USB dongle you can plug into has removed the backlight and I initially thought it was broken/inoperable before I realized they removed the light.

"R12ZP43LF7BB99","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021",4,"Good, But Could Be Better","I upgraded to this from the Corsair HS35 because I wanted a wireless headset so that I wouldn't have to remove the headset and miss out on stuff every time I had to step away.The order arrived completely intact and without incident the day after I placed my order.I tested it out immediately, and I have been using it consistently for about a week now.It definitely serves its intended purpose (to give me a wireless option).The range on it is pretty good.I am able to walk all around the ground floor of my house and even walk outside my front door to pickup deliveries and still maintain connection.However, sometimes the connection is spotty, regardless of how far away I am from my computer, including sometimes if I am sitting right in front of it.I notice that sometimes, as I am walking away from the computer, if I move to fast, it takes time for it to catch up, so it's kind of in-and-out.But whenever I have such connection issues, usually if I power it down, remove the dongle from the USB port, re-insert it, and turn the headphones back on, the connection issues disappear.Some other things that I dislike about this:1.Size:it is adjustable, but even at its smallest, it is still a little loose on my head (for reference, my hat size is 7 1/2, although that doesn't exactly translate to a headset).While the HS35 fits perfectly, because these are a little loose, the band doesn't sit on top of my head, so my ears are really the only thing supporting it, and pretty often I can feel it slipping down on my ears, so I have to adjust it.2.When I did some testing, the recordings I did with this mic were not as clear and crisp as the ones I did with the HS35 mic.The speakers, however, seem to be pretty comparable.Other than the freedom of a wireless headset, one thing that I did like about this is that it comes with it's own windscreen, which is pretty important to me because there is a lot of background noise in the room where I use it.The windscreen does a good job filtering out the background noise.And because it comes with one, it is a perfect fit.The HS35 did not come with one, so I had to by some separately (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EJ0N5FS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which do not fit perfectly, and fall off frequently.Overall, I am pleased with Corsair HS70.For the price, you will not find a better wireless headset.Overall, I like the HS35 better, but the freedom that the wireless HS70 provides is definitely enough to make it my primary headset for the time being.I am giving it 4 stars, but it's probably more like a 3.5.I went back and forth between 3 and 4, but in the end, I felt 3 was a little too harsh.So, yes.Four stars, but really more like a 3.5.",true,1,18,"118","B07X9W721J","corsair virtuoso",true,79.99,"USD",99.99,20,20,3479,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9W721J","14959.70",false,false,false,false,"Corsair HS70 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset - 7.1 Surround Sound Headphones for PC, MacOS, PS5, PS4 - Discord Certified - 50m...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XjjJovijL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Before the end-of-January, I had to send them back cut to a component failure. As shown in the pictures, they use a plastic cover piece to secure the headphones and hold them in place with metal screws going into plastic parts. As you adjust the headphones to your head (my wife & son share these) you are constantly re-adjusting to a comfortable fit. This is the problem. I just had my second pair fail, due to the same issue. Only this time around we were ""on guard"", to be extremely careful when adjusting. They failed on me today as I was on a TEAMS Chat conference call. The headset works fantastic. The features are great. Adjustable sound, mute, removable boom mike. All great and work fantastically. BUT, one of the most important components in the build is made from very thin, cheap, plastic. If they would spend just a little more money and use aluminum this problem would be cured. I will never buy another one of their products again.

"R2UOTYDJWTAWF3","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",5,"Excellent headset and versatility, but subpar software","I want to preface this by saying I've had this headset for a year and a half and has held up well through the somewhat torture I've given it! Keep in mind I use this headset anywhere from 10-25 hours a week so if that gives you any idea as to how much I've used these, do with that as you will. Anyways here's a pros and cons list to simplify it with a summary to recap my thoughts on this headset.Pros:-The versatility of these headphones is great mainly because you can plug them into your pc or console, charge them and keep playing or just use them while plugged in, AND connect them to your phone with an aux cord if you wanna walk around with them and blast music.-The sound quality is phenomenal with highs being crisp and lows being bassy and the mids filling the gaps to make a smoothsound or listening to music a joy. The sound isolation is great as you can hear the footsteps of someone below, above, behind. It makes a very immersive experience as it can turn a roar from a zombie around the corner go from ""ehh"", to ""holy hell what was that, and where did it come from"" experience. Not always obviously, but I've never gotten an experience like this from any other headset.-They look great, and have held up well even though I can be a bit rough with them from time to time.-When Icue works the customization for the EQ is impressive and enhances the experience if done right. Though careful, with a custom EQ, because if you push it too high or low you could have distortion issues. Something to be aware of as I feel this is more of a software issue rather than the headsets ability to produce the desired sound you want.-Mic quality is superb wireless and connected. I've never had anyone have problems with my mic quality being poor or choppy. Only time there's issues with this is either some software, program, or internet issues and not the mic itself.Cons:-Not a surprise but the cost is up there, but honestly I've gotten my money's worth and they keep going strong after a year and a half so it's a con, but small at this point.-The ear cups are not made to last. I did have to replace the ear cups after about 6 months of regular use, and it wasn't the most comfortable tbh, but I found bigger/better replacement Earcups from a 3rd party that were more much comfortable and have held up better (I have a big head and ears so this was a great find) at the cost of loss to noise canceling it is ""supposed"" to have.-Battery life on these are pretty good, but not 20 hours as they advertise. Even when they were brand new I was getting MAYBE 14-16 hours if conditions were perfect, but not 20. This being said the LI-Ion battery still gets me a solid 10 hours on a full charge and the recharge is quick so I can just throw the cable on to charge while staying in ""wireless"" mode and then 30min have passed and it's back to green again so it's a con for not completely accurate advertising, but not terrible battery life by any stretch. Just unrealistic.Cons unrelated to the headset itself, but corsairs software issues:-RGB... Idk WHY, when you turn on the headset, the mic goes RGB and shows the rainbow, but then you can not customize the mic color at all. WHY show that off and then not come through. Solid miss there.-until recently I HATED ICue but I had no choice but to use it for my headset, but with some recent updates it's gotten better. Less buggy and more dependable, but when my headset acts up I usually look at ICue first to make sure it isn't the, poor excuse for, software causing the issue.-ICue is just a very subpar app and honestly needs some major work. Idk why it's as buggy as it is because this headset deserved better than this. I won't drag the rating down because of something the app does wrong where as the headset itself is pretty dang great.-I'm lumping this in the software issue seeing as it's controlled through Icue is the 7.1 surround sound is not phenomenal. It's pretty good in some games that have surround sound features enabled, but for movies, shows, music ect. It's not great as it sometimes cuts out the mids HARD to the point where sometimes an explosion sounds muffled or just wonky for a lack of a better term. Also the higher frequencies tend to get swollowed up during bassier sequences in whatever it is so it leaves it feeling hollow in many scenes. My advice is stick with the stereo setting as it does a pretty great job of sounding equal and correct in any setting rather than hit or miss with everything. Nifty idea that fell flat imo.-voice prompts... Just... Don't use that setting...Finally the...Summary:Overall I maybe leaving a few things out, but most of the cons on the headset itself are little or not a deal breaker (atleast for me), but things to think on how to improve the virtuoso descendants going forward. I personally love the headset itself and there's more I could say, but at this point you'll have based most of your decision on what I said earlier if you even made it this far lol. My biggest gripes are the ICue software we're forced to deal with as it maybe ""esthetically"" pleasing to look at. It's a far cry from great, or even good. As it stands now it works mostly, but the bugs drive me insane. The lack of thought to letting people mess with the mics light colors is what lends me to believe it's lazy or just cheap to not let people do what they want which is just rediculous to me. I digress from this bit of rage here. In all a great headset itself, but poor software to harness all of the greatness.Headset - 9/10 few fixes/adjustments and it would probably be perfectSoftware (Icue) - was 3 - now after many updates later 6/10. If they could focus on a great customer experience and fix the bugs rather than just cheap implementation of features or lack there of for that matter, and some which haven't changed.

"R31V5T0LLEHI03","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",4,"Love the headset; usb dongel is weak point","Zero issues with the headset itself. Compressed but clear microphone, great sound, comfy and strong construction... its everything I wanted at a decent price point... even if I look like Princess Leia while wearing it.My main issue is with the usb dongle. As the description says, this is a wireless headset that uses a proprietary usb to connect to your computer. Better models have a 3.5mm option, but this one does not. A usb to micro usb is including, but it only works for charging. It does not allow the headset to be used wired (or at least that is my understanding from an hour of googling).I've had the product for around 4 months, so I am past the 90 day warranty. However, as can be seen in the photo, my usb dongle has broken with the circuit board exposed. I can still plug it in, but none of my computers can recognize it. I don't know what caused it; I didn't step on it or anything but noticed that the seam on the dongle started to separate around last week.

"R12ZP43LF7BB99","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021",4,"Good, But Could Be Better","I upgraded to this from the Corsair HS35 because I wanted a wireless headset so that I wouldn't have to remove the headset and miss out on stuff every time I had to step away.The order arrived completely intact and without incident the day after I placed my order.I tested it out immediately, and I have been using it consistently for about a week now.It definitely serves its intended purpose (to give me a wireless option).The range on it is pretty good.I am able to walk all around the ground floor of my house and even walk outside my front door to pickup deliveries and still maintain connection.However, sometimes the connection is spotty, regardless of how far away I am from my computer, including sometimes if I am sitting right in front of it.I notice that sometimes, as I am walking away from the computer, if I move to fast, it takes time for it to catch up, so it's kind of in-and-out.But whenever I have such connection issues, usually if I power it down, remove the dongle from the USB port, re-insert it, and turn the headphones back on, the connection issues disappear.Some other things that I dislike about this:1.Size:it is adjustable, but even at its smallest, it is still a little loose on my head (for reference, my hat size is 7 1/2, although that doesn't exactly translate to a headset).While the HS35 fits perfectly, because these are a little loose, the band doesn't sit on top of my head, so my ears are really the only thing supporting it, and pretty often I can feel it slipping down on my ears, so I have to adjust it.2.When I did some testing, the recordings I did with this mic were not as clear and crisp as the ones I did with the HS35 mic.The speakers, however, seem to be pretty comparable.Other than the freedom of a wireless headset, one thing that I did like about this is that it comes with it's own windscreen, which is pretty important to me because there is a lot of background noise in the room where I use it.The windscreen does a good job filtering out the background noise.And because it comes with one, it is a perfect fit.The HS35 did not come with one, so I had to by some separately (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EJ0N5FS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which do not fit perfectly, and fall off frequently.Overall, I am pleased with Corsair HS70.For the price, you will not find a better wireless headset.Overall, I like the HS35 better, but the freedom that the wireless HS70 provides is definitely enough to make it my primary headset for the time being.I am giving it 4 stars, but it's probably more like a 3.5.I went back and forth between 3 and 4, but in the end, I felt 3 was a little too harsh.So, yes.Four stars, but really more like a 3.5.",true,1,14,"114","B07X9W721J","corsair void",true,79.99,"USD",99.99,20,20,3479,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9W721J","14959.70",false,false,false,false,"Corsair HS70 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset - 7.1 Surround Sound Headphones for PC, MacOS, PS5, PS4 - Discord Certified - 50m...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XjjJovijL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The features are great. Adjustable sound, mute, removable boom mike. All great and work fantastically. BUT, one of the most important components in the build is made from very thin, cheap, plastic.

"R2NJCXPJ9V2VB3","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",3,"Average sound quality, quiet mic, not that comfortable","I bought into all the YouTube reviews hyping this headset. Bought a pair to see for myself and they didn’t meet expectations. Maybe it was due to all the reviews. The material and aesthetics are good and feel premium, but there were too many downsides for me to keep them.Out of the box sound quality is pretty average at best, with weak bass. Note, I never messed with the EQ settings so it's possible this can be fixed with some tweaking. Games might sound fine and if you don’t care about really good sound quality for anything else.Mic quality is actually really solid, but unfortunately really quiet. I’m sure you can increase it with some software, but Corsair should really fix that on their end. The red LED when the mic is in the mute position can get pretty distracting if on a video conference as there is no way to turn it off.For me, it wasn't super comfortable, although you can probably still wear them for long sessions without issues. I have a medium to large head and the strap is enough for me. It feels a bit too heavy and the clamping force is on the strong side.The on/off button has some issues. At times, it seems like the button doesn't register and you have to press and hold a couple of times on the right position. I even got a replacement thinking it was just that headset, but it had the same issue. I could have lived with it, if not for all the other issues.If you really just need a wireless headset with a good mic and are fine with everything else, this could work for you. I really wanted to like them, but for $150, I personally don’t think it’s worth it with all the downsides. If it was priced around $100, I might have kept them.",true,1,15,"115","B09BBPTDWX","corsair void",false,149.99,"USD",0,0,0,34,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BBPTDWX","136.00",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR HS80 RGB Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with Spatial Audio - Works with Mac, PC, PS5, PS4 - Carbon","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SzBbPQQeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
"R4K5DDTJXA51Z","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",4,"Very impressive!","If I’m being honest, the reviews almost had me running the other direction. I decided to take a leap and give them a shot anyway, and I’m glad I did! I’m a bit of an audiophile and usually rely on a dedicated amp/usb mic/audiophile cans for my gaming needs, but I wanted something wireless that I could also use on my ps5. I’ve tried many other headsets some of which included Jbl Quantum 800s, Steelseries Arctis 7ps, Audeze Penrose, and Beoplay Portals. Although, all of those are good headsets in their own right, something about them that caused me to lose interest and ultimately either return or even sell them for a loss. Generally it was either comfort, connection issues, low volume on console, or poor quality mic that was the leading culprit.Now the HS80s at $150 do everything right while managing to do nothing offensively wrong. They aren’t perfect by any means but what they manage to do at that price point is sound fantastic, have a stable connection, are extremely comfortable, and have the best wireless mic I have ever used. They also work seamlessly on PS5 and get so loud that no person using them would need to go higher than 60%.The only fault I can give these are due to software alone. For people that have used ICUE you already know the issues, but for people that haven’t, it can be particular and require some finesse to get everything working right. One issue I have is every time I turn them on they default to 8 channel audio regardless of them being set to stereo in ICUE. It’s not a huge deal you just go into your sound settings on windows and change it to 2 channel 24 bit 48khz and they sound amazing after that.

"RLYFSK6IKTRUJ","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021",3,"Narrow earcups and very quiet microphone","TLDR the audio is great with light tuning in the EQ and the microphone QUALITY is amazing, but the overall mic volume is too low for me, even with Windows settings maxed out, and the earcups are a tad narrow causing some constant light pressure along the back of my ear, especially if walking around.If the microphone volume was acceptable I could have lived with the earcups.The audio quality out of the box wasn't the best, the mids are a bit too strong and muddle the highs.Messing with the eq and raising the highs gave an amazing sound which is among the best in headsets at this price range, from my experience. The sound is a little richer and cleaner than what I get from my Arctis 7s.The cloth earcups do mean you miss a bit of the bass, but I didn't find the experience lacking since the mids were stronger and helped fill the gap.This headset doesn't offer any 3d audio or surround sound simulations.The microphone was probably the best and worst thing about this headset at the same time.For a wireless headset, the quality of this microphone is ASTOUNDING.I've used a Blue Yeti and AT2020USB as desk microphones in the past and on a purely quality review, this microphone is right there with them for anything but the purest audiophile.Where the microphone suffers is the volume.I'm unsure if my model was defective (due to other concerns below I didn't choose to replace to see and instead did a refund), but even with every mic setting I could find in Windows and the Corsair software maxed out, my friend had to set me to 200% in discord compared to my Arctis 1s or 7s at a normal 100%.If you plan to also use this as a work headset as well, the volume might not be great for zoom or teams calls.I did not test to see how much this microphone could be boosted in OBS capture for streaming.The fit of the headband support is great and the inside adjustments are good if slightly limited, but the earcups were a bit too narrow for me.The memory foam compresses nicely, but when work there was a mild constant pressure against the back of my ears.For normal sitting and gaming it was fine, but since it is wireless, getting up and walking around made it was noticeable for any tiny movements of the headset.Apart from the ears, the overall clamp and fit was perfect though - my Arctis 7 which uses a similar elastic strap system was always too loose for my head and slipped around heavily when walking or bending, but this never seemed at risk of sliding off.",true,1,15,"115","B09BBPTDWX","corsair void",false,149.99,"USD",0,0,0,34,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BBPTDWX","136.00",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR HS80 RGB Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with Spatial Audio - Works with Mac, PC, PS5, PS4 - Carbon","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SzBbPQQeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

A couple issues I have are that the webcam stopped working after a month of owning the machine, but I don't use the webcam often and it's just one of those nit picky things people have. However, I wouldn't recommend this laptop to anyone. I'd say save your money and get a Desktop and something along the lines of an i5 or an i7 Ultrabook.UPDATE: So, Dell support won't do anything to fix it or send me a new unit all together even though the computer is still under warranty. Also every once in a while the Windows key won't work for god knows how long.

"R1MO3GMYRBW1DC","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2021",4,"A Solid Work Laptop for Office & Travel","As someone who uses a 13"" MacBook Pro as my personal computer, I wanted something comparable for my work set up, which requires the use of Windows to run proprietary applications. The Dell XPS was the closest Windows-based PC that I could find to the MacBook Pro, both in terms of performance and form factor.The Dell has a smaller footprint than my MacBook Pro, which already has a pretty small footprint to begin with. The thinner bezel on the XPS makes the screen look even larger than it is, while also allowing the laptop to be a good bit smaller.The OLED screen on the XPS is very nice, though it can look a little washed out at time. Overall, it's pretty crisp and 4k videos look great. I still prefer the MacBook Pro screen, but I'm not exactly a screen snob. The touch screen seems to do what touch screens do, but I don't ever use it, so I can't say how good or bad it might be on a day-to-day basis. I prefer to keep my hands off my screens.The keyboard on the XPS is nice. There isn't a ton of key travel, but enough that you can at least feel your way around and the likelihood of double-tapping keys by mistake is very slim.Performance-wise, I think it's fine for most of what I do. I believe it is a little weaker in terms of performance than my M1 MacBook Pro, but not by a huge amount. Some applications have trouble opening, Outlook freezes from time-to-time, and I have some hangups with a few Adobe CC programs that I don't get on my M1 Mac, but overall it does what I need it to do at the office.The battery life is pretty weak unless you adjust the slider way down toward the ""best battery life"" section rather than the ""best performance"" section. I understand upping performance sacrifices battery life, but even when I'm not all the way up toward better performance, the battery life takes a major hit.The webcam is trash. I'm just going to be honest. I don't really care, because I don't really do Zoom calls or anything like that, but I am admittedly shocked at how awful it is.I dock the XPS at the office and take it with me when I travel, so it's nice to have such a compact laptop with solid (albeit not elite) performance. I still have only heard the fan come on a handful of times, and it's definitely not loud and I have yet to have my thermals get out of whack. Granted, I'm not exporting 8K videos or anything.

The pen tip is much more durable and precise, the buttons are placed high up enough so that you aren't accidentally pressing them while writing (a problem I had with the Bamboo ink), it has a magnet to hold to your laptop, and a huge perk for me is that this pen takes AAA batteries.

"R212YO6HL4VTWP","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2021",1,"Hinge and Screen fell apart after 18 months and had to replace the keyboard - Over $900 spent","I did not realize that this model did not include a DVD drive so I had to buy one. After less than 18 months, I noticed the right hinge was popping out. That lead to me calling Dell and they were of no use, etc. and wanted $160 to analyze it. I called a local computer tech and that led to needing to replace the keyboard. Now I am faced with not being able to close the lid as the hinge issue has caused the screen to fall apart and separate. I have no idea what the repair will be this time and am faced with having to pay for an extensive body repair or buy a replacement computer. I do not recommend this product or if you do buy it, pay for the extended warranty. I have owned this computer since Dec 2018 and have already put more than $200 into it.April 5, 2021 Update: Today's repair was an additional $265. The tech had to replace the laptop body and said that he has never seen such brittle plastic in his 20 years of experience. Not only did all the little rivet's fall out, but three of the hinge screws were broken out of the plastic.

"R30KOIF5WF734F","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2021",1,"I've never regretted a purchase more! Do not buy this!","I bought this after reading a review that said it was ""approaching perfection"" - clearly it didn't get very close. I now know that there are multiple extremely disruptive KNOWN flaws to this machine that Dell has not fixed in years of putting out new XPS laptops. Here's a few that I've had with it right out of the box...1) Trackpad wobble. When I first got the computer I thought, this is the wobble they're complaining about? It's nothing! By a month later it was driving me insane.2) Cursor jumps around, disappears, clicks, moves when it shouldn't, etc. When it's doing this, the trackpad is unusable and you have to use an external mouse.3) The screen sometimes turns on at an extremely low brightness, far dimmer than the lowest brightness setting, and it can't be changed by turning it up. You have to turn off the screen and turn it back on again. If you don't catch that it's on (easy because it's so dim) you might end up clicking something trying to get your screen to turn on.4) One of the screws in the back corner needs to be tightened constantly or the screen section will move around.5) Blue screens at least once a week.6) Alt-tab sometimes randomly starts working, fixes with restart but it's irritating to have to do that often.7) Sometimes clicking on icons in the start bar will do nothing.8) Sometimes gets so hot that the surface is uncomfortable to rest my palm on.Another preferential thing is that I really recommend getting a computer with a USB-A port; there are still a lot of things with that plug. For example, pretty much all USB receivers for mouse/keyboard combos come with a USB-A plug. Because of the trackpad issues, the one USB-A port on the included dongle is always taken up with my mouse receiver. I had to buy my own dongle that's really irritating to carry around to accommodate anything else that needs USB-A.Do NOT buy this computer. I wanted it to last me at least 5 years and I'm not sure if I can stand using it for even one. $2000 down the drain.",true,1,18,"117","B089HJX59L","dell g-series",false,2348,"USD",0,0,0,375,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089HJX59L","1575.00",false,false,false,false,"Dell XPS 15 - 15 Inch FHD+, Intel Core i7 10th Gen, 16GB Memory, 512GB Solid State Drive, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti 4GB G...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rsoANm7tL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Thanks to COVID-19, all mu classes were online and I had to do a Zoom call pretty much every day. However, I noticed that the screen was a little off whenever I connected to a Zoom meeting. Everything, all the letters, all the faces, and all the images were blurred, and I could never fix that problem. I just got used to the idea that if I was connected to Zoom, I couldn’t use any other feature of my laptop. There were times when I needed to search for some information on Google and I had to use my phone because I couldn’t read anything!On top of that, today my laptop decided to shut down completely. I’ve charged it for hours, I’ve been trying to turn it on, everything seems to be fine, but the screen doesn’t turn on! Honestly, this was the worst investment in my life, and and to make it even worse, I had to buy it in the middle of a pandemic that affected my income, just to be able to study! Now I can’t study at all, and now that I found a job, I can’t even work properly because this laptop DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.I’ve only had it for two months, TWO MONTHS. I’ve never dropped it, I take a good care of it, I don’t even have that many documents or apps that could be damaging it somehow. It’s so frustrating to buy a thing that you hope to rely on and it turns to be a complete disaster.This is the second Dell I’ve owned, and the first one decided to die one day and I couldn’t never turn it on again.

After less than 18 months, I noticed the right hinge was popping out. That lead to me calling Dell and they were of no use, etc. and wanted $160 to analyze it. I called a local computer tech and that led to needing to replace the keyboard. Now I am faced with not being able to close the lid as the hinge issue has caused the screen to fall apart and separate. I have no idea what the repair will be this time and am faced with having to pay for an extensive body repair or buy a replacement computer. I do not recommend this product or if you do buy it, pay for the extended warranty. I have owned this computer since Dec 2018 and have already put more than $200 into it.April 5, 2021 Update: Today's repair was an additional $265. The tech had to replace the laptop body and said that he has never seen such brittle plastic in his 20 years of experience. Not only did all the little rivet's fall out, but three of the hinge screws were broken out of the plastic. What was even more depressing was that the replacement body's screen is not a touch screen as I had before. Overall, do not buy this unit. I have owned or possessed at least 16 Dells over the years via business and personal use. I am not down on Dell, but this laptop really stinks. I have over $900 invested in this laptop now.

So I ran mem tests, checked event logs etc. Everything came back fine. Fired it up to full functionality and after about 30 mins on just browsing the web, BSOD again. This time checking the laptop it was hot enough that it didn't want to touch it much. So I let it cool and put a laptop cooler under it and it has worked great since. This is a design flaw I believe as to where the vents are located slightly below the inner portion of the hinge from the lid.The pc itself is great.

The adaptive brightness setting is NOT an option on this laptop.Overall - I had the felling of being cheated with this DELL Inspiron 15 5000.

I have to much money in it to throw it away and I have no children or grandchildren to give it to. I realize that it is my mistake for not researching this purchase properly beforehand.

Under most conditions you can not see any of the letters/numerals making it very difficult for a lousy typist like me. The mouse pad is large but requires a certain amount of force to operate so the pointer ends up usually any place other than what you want it to be.

"R3DEORQNBOC7FU","Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2021",4,"Chose for ports and amount of RAM, already having issue w/key not working","This has the HDMI and ethernet and USB ports I needed, which were harder to find than I expected. Also the 12GB of RAM beats most of the ones in this price range. Aside from certain keys being in less convenient positions, I have had no complaints until today when I realized the Insert key works in that it presses, but it does not toggle the insert mode. It's always in overwrite mode. This feature is probably so rarely used by most users that they thought nobody would notice. However, it would make what I'm working on much easier. I also must hold Fn key to enable home and end keys to work, which is annoying but at least they work.Calling Dell support had me in tears when ""Puneet"" took remote control of my computer and immediately closed the browser window, despite my shouting to not do so. I had numerous tabs open with important work, and he didn't even ask, then said he made a mistake and meant to minimize it. What an idiot. I was not using Chrome (and was panicking) so I had trouble finding the ""recently closed"" option, which thankfully restored my tabs but what a giant tool.Anyway his test failed, meaning the key is defective, and my only option is to mail in the only computer I have right now and be without it for 2-3 weeks. I am sure there must be an easier fix, like some setting is not set correctly, but they want their sweet warranty bucks and tried selling me the premium plan. When I had a Dell in the past, a tech guy came to my home, so it's pretty galling that I'd have to pay $119 to get a defective computer fixed or be without it for weeks. (I didn't ask but assume I'd have to pay to ship it for service, which won't be cheap either.) And $119 is for a lower 1-year warranty that won't cover physical damage; that would cost $169.BTW calling support went south from the start. A voice comes on and says there are numbers on the underside of your device, so enter it now. It gives you about 2 seconds to turn the computer over and scrutinize the label to find the number among the many others. To top it off, my label was all smudged as if it had been damaged by water but stuck on anyway. I had no idea what I was looking for and the automated voice switched me to Sales, then sales switched me to tech support, and I could have easily found this service tag number by going to the Dell support page, which automatically recognizes your device and displays it. So more unnecessary stress. No wonder Dell is struggling.",true,1,18,"117","B08TBFR4ZB","dell inspiron 2017",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,110,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TBFR4ZB","506.00",false,false,false,false,"Dell Inspiron 15 3505 Full HD Laptop (FHD), 15.6 inch - AMD Ryzen 5 3450U, 12GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Gra...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81syFo9ehwL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I went with blue clicky switches and they are kind of meh. Haven't taken the time to lube them but the space bar sounds incredibly hollow and different compared to the rest of the keys, you can really tell when the space is being pressed.I had to use the cable it came with to get my computer to auto-download the drivers. After that it worked with my Glorious coiled cable. Mine is a USB-C all though the ad does still show micro usb in their photos.The RK software does absolutely nothing for me, neither does the firmware download. It's a pain to get it to even download and when it does open it just shows a keyboard with absolutely no options to choose from or anything.. it literally does nothing.

On top of that, holding function and hitting left control toggles between layers. Function, and LEFT CONTROL. This has caused MANY MANY issues, and is probably going to be the downfall of this keyboard.In Pop_OS, my OS of choice, control is used in conjunction with print screen to save screenshots to the clipboard. Which I use ALL the time. I have to fight with this thing to just take a screenshot. The Pok3r forgoes a menu key (which isn't really used much) for an extra key, labeled ""pn"", that's used for functions like that.There are PLENTY of things that the Pok3r does better than this keyboard.

But the side scroll is defunct and the forward/back buttons are literally on top of each other in a diagonal fashion. This makes it very tough to hit the correct button the first time. Worst of all however is the fact the polling rate is only 125hz. They say you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.. well with this mouse you can take 100 shots and miss a damn well lot of them due to the low rate. Again, returning this as well and getting the G502 wireless.Logitech needs to rethink their branding for this keyboard/mouse. You can even see from a lot of the reviewers here, this is ideally an OFFICE keyboard/mouse setup. Not a gaming setup! The gaming equivalents are the G915 keyboard and G502 or G903 or G604 or G703 or.. y'know what? There's a lot of good logitech gaming mice out there..

The switches would routinely duplicate the letters, and at one point even the backspace key failed (same style switch). Thankfully the switches are replaceable with a little soldering skill, but this is a real nuisance.

STILL having switch failures. On the original keyboard I have now replaced a total of EIGHT switches, on the newer one I've had to replace two.Until/unless Logitech gets better switches I would avoid this keyboard. I didn't bother going through customer service because I knew I could repair this issue myself, but not everyone has the tools or is handy. If you're handy and don't mind replacing switches, I've otherwise enjoyed the keyboard. Keystrokes are nice, responsiveness is excellent, and the range of the wireless is great.

The RGB’s panicked, shut down, only returned the rim lightning to “normal” after unplugging and replugging, and left the actual keyboard completely and utterly unusable.NONE of the keys worked. I tried pushing reset buttons, pulled the cord again, let the keyboard sit, attempted to utilize the company software, NOTHING fixed it.

YouTube video reported.There were some negative reviews, but there are almost always at least some.If they're less than 10% especially, and if the 5-star ratings are substantially high, I will usually try the product and I generally end up satisfied.The YouTube video STRESSED following instructions for installation and use with 3rd party software, which I followed step by step.The fact that the instructions weren't written by the company itself should not be held against the product, but I found it rather difficult to follow the instructions despite having been a general class amateur radio license holder for many years, with considerable familiarity with electronics in general.I was highly disappointed.I may have gotten a single defective unit, but I decided to return it and not bother with a replacement.Amazon was outstanding with an almost immediate refund as soon as the UPS Store registered their receipt of the product for return.Amazon is GREAT in that regard!First, the device was extremely(!) hot!I could only barely stand to hold it in my hand for more than a few moments to remove it from the computer.I cannot believe that's standard, and if it is, I don't believe it's properly designed.One of the major reasons for failure of electronics is heat - and this is quite excessive in my opinion and experience.Second, despite good familiarity with antenna theory and significant attempts to maximize the antenna tuning to the desired frequency of reception, I was never able to tune in ANY stations outside of the usual FM Radio broadcast band beginning at 88.0 mhz.No lower, no higher frequencies that just that band.I can listen to other FM radios in my home without spending nearly $50 for this.Again, I may have had a faulty unit based on many of the reviews, but decided it wasn't worth another try, at least with this brand.And in any case, be prepared to do some study about antenna design and characteristics as well as getting some software that will properly tune everything together (antenna and this product).I was excited about this, and hoped for far more.Yes, I am indoors with it, but others report far better results indoors, and I placed the antenna right next to an outside window with almost nothing nearby to provide interference (which I didn't seem to be picking up anyway with the receiver.Your mileage may vary, in all fairness.",true,1,12,"111","B011HVUEME","fuhlen g90",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,3672,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011HVUEME","16524.00",false,false,true,false,"RTL-SDR Blog V3 R820T2 RTL2832U 1PPM TCXO HF Bias Tee SMA Software Defined Radio with Dipole Antenna Kit","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+A7O72aCL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

While I like the low-profile approach to this keyboard, whoever decided to not only NOT illuminate the shift characters but also flip their position on the key faces is an absolute imbecile and should not have any say on designing a keyboard in this price range. That kind of design decision is something I expect out of the junk keyboards I get when purchasing refurbished computers for my company...not an $185 gaming keyboard.All that said, outside the lighting and stupid character layout decision, the rest of the keyboard works quite nicely. I have a little bit of a ""springy"" sound on my ""s"" key that's been there since day-1 but otherwise no hardware issues to speak of.Software wise, it's really annoying to have to use G-hub constantly if you want this keyboard to be really functional. I say that because without G-hub running the keyboard defaults to a pattern where it flashes all the colors in a big wave which gets incredibly distracting in your peripherals. If you turn off lighting entirely the same idiot that designed these key faces decided to do dark grey on black. It doesn't impact myself as I've spent 8hr+ a day on a keyboard for 15yrs now but if you don't know how to memory type you're going to be up the creek without G-hub running and you're really going to hate finding those rare shift characters.If you're someone just starting out coding this keyboard is especially not for you, you're basically going to be chicken pecking like your dad because you can't see a thing.",true,1,16,"115","B085RLZ1C4","fuhlen g90",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,5355,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RLZ1C4","25168.50",false,false,false,false,"Logitech G915 TKL Tenkeyless Lightspeed Wireless RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Low Profile Switch Options, Lightsync RG...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V2O4vbYhL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2K3H97LQ3T8B9","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021",4,"Powerful PC that will accomplish any task","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. I was a bit worried when I ordered this PC because it shipped from Delaware and I live in California. After 4-5 days, it made its journey safety across the United States with no issues thankfully. The PC is packed into precut high quality foam, wrapped in plastic, inside a thick cardboard box. I have not used tech support yet so no comment on that.I have only had the pc a week and a half, but so far so good. PC comes preinstalled with windows 10 and some bloat ware such as Microsoft one drive, Mc Afee, and a few other programs. Omen gaming hub is nice software that you can use to customize the lights on your pc, overlock your processor, and to watch your temps. Reading a lot of reviews beforehand I know this pc can run really hot, and that was my main concern. I installed cyberpunk 2077 and ran it on ultra setting with ray tracing. It looks beautiful but the pc did get quite loud. It also got pretty hot too. My CPU bounced around 88-91 C, where this processors max temp is 100 C before it shuts off. After turning Vsync on and ray tracing off, the temps and loudness dropped significantly. CPU sits in the 70s C and GPU sits in the 60s C.I live streamed all weekend a couple games: world of Warcraft and cyberpunk 2077. The processor can easily handle high end gaming and streaming at the same time, as long as you are reasonable with the settings. If you’re playing cyberpunk 2077 on ultra ray tracing while streaming, your computer will get very hot and loud. If you cap vsync at 60 or 90 frames, you shouldn’t have an issue with high heat or noise. Remember, this processor and graphics card are powerful hardware, they will get hot! The case and fans does it’s job though if you’re playing games on medium settings. I keep my fans on turbo and Vsync on and don’t have any issues with overheating or loudness. I haven’t overclocked my PC yet. Like any powerful gaming rig, this PC is a space heater! It will need to sit on a desk or in the open air. Your room will get warm. It feels nice right now during these cold nights but I can’t imagine this PC in the summer with no a/c.You will be pleased at how this PC performs. You will have to find the right settings for you to keep the temps and loudness at bay when running demanding games, but that’s to be expected with such powerful hardware in a snug case. Older games like WoW you don’t need Vsync. I get 300-400 fps on max settings.",true,1,1,"11","B08HR91FHT","hp omen",false,2999.95,"USD",0,0,0,878,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HR91FHT","3775.40",false,false,false,false,"OMEN 30L Gaming Desktop PC, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Graphics Card, 10th Generation Intel Core i9-10900K Processor, 32 GB R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81yGv35VljL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R164G2WJILL5VT","Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2021",5,"the temperature problem","I purchased this Omen 30L (HP Model# GT13-0092) over a month ago. I have no complaints besides how expensive PC gaming is... lolGPU = RTX 3080CPU = Intel Core i9-10850K.32 GB RamI want to address the number 1 complaint I found while researching this PC, the temperatures. The temperatures and fan noise but it's all related. Yes, it is a problem. Things get too hot (80C+) and the fans kick on the high setting during gaming. It was a common thing before I looked into fixing it.The temperature problem is with the CPU. That's the liquid cooled part and it is liquid cooled because CPUs run hot in general. You should first make sure those lines are not kinked. I read about that being a thing for some people.The next thing you should do to fix the temperatures is to reduce the maximum power the CPU uses. You can find it in the advanced power settings for the computer. There is a section where you can select the minimum and maximum power states of the CPU. Instead of 100%, max the CPU at a few percent less. I can tell you from experience that 95% works great but you may be able to get away with 98% (I'm currently testing this).This has proven to be a great fix for the temperature problem in my experience with it. I'm not even concerned about it anymore. This Omen PC is limited by the GPU and not the CPU so running the CPU at 95-98% doesn't affect performance. Even with my CPU at 95%, games tell me that the GPU is my bottleneck.About the noise of the fans. I think it's a little ridiculous that people complain so strongly about it. I don't think the fans are overly loud. Definitely perfectly quiet when they are running normally and with the fix I mentioned it's basically always that way. But with that said, I heard a youtuber complaining about how loud hard drives are when they click while loading. If you are someone bothered by hard drives clicking then yes, the fans are too loud for you as well.

I bought it primarily for video editing and was a little skeptical due to some of the reviews about the display and speakers. But I took a chance...and now I'm really glad I DID! Great features for the price. I don't play online games so I'll never use some of the features like the assignable keyboard color schemes or overclocking, but this machine has all the graphics power I need and didn't cost me a fortune. Plenty of USB ports. Since most of my cameras use SD cards I truly appreciate the built-in SD card reader slot. Extremely easy to upgrade memory and add a 2nd drive - that was a big one for me. Fan noise was VERY minimal and not an issue at all for me (others said it was loud) even when overclocked. It DOES make a bit more noise when overclocked, but (duh!) that's the fans doing their jobs and keeping you from frying your processors. And as for my display and audio worries? Well...I don't know what kind of displays the folks who were critical of it were used to, but this thing is PLENTY sharp and bright enough for me to edit with. Good color representation with plenty of range and no banding or blocking. Deep blacks, great grays, and amazing color. The audio is also PLENTY loud for my purposes. Even with just the built-in speakers, this machine pumps out all the volume I need while keeping it nice and crisp. And if I want more, I'll just patch it in to my studio sound system and make the neighbors start complaining on me...LOL!

I'd like to sneak it into the office, but I will have to explain that logo, which I cant even explain now. Its also ugly.Ok, now the (very) good...This version has more features than I expected. The bios and mainboard not only supports undervolting, (earlier versions of the 17"" omens did not) but they've even designed a feature where the user can select either 'Optimize' the undervoltage setting by automatically finding that sweet spot, or 'Custom' where you can set it yourself. The screen is bright and has great color and contrast. The mousepad feels nice and responsive. The fans aren't too noisy, its about the volume I expected when running full speed. Now, about 'sneaking it into the office'; if your worried about fan noise, there's an app that comes with the Nvidia GPU that you can access and set it to 'Whisper mode', and what that will do is it will cap the framerate to whatever you want,the lowest being 30 FPS, which is aboutstandard blu-ray or DVD movie framerate anyway, and that will help keep the fans from spooling up.Two reasons I picked the 17"" is because I wanted a bigger screen, but also wanted a laptop that can dissipate heat, and I feel many of those thin designs might have difficulty there. There were some concerns about the hinge design and positions and screen torsional flex, but now that I can see them for myself, I am unconcerned and I would say they are fine. They are pretty firm, and there is some screen flexing, but just a littlemore than the other laptops I own.The final deciding factor is that I've had good experience with HPs. The last two companies I worked for used HP exclusively for their laptops, and I own a 17"" HP Envy which was a beast when I got it 7 years ago, its still my go-to business laptop to this day with zero issues.I believe the Omen 17"" laptop will give you the best bang for your hard earned buck.I just hate that logo, whatever its supposed to be.",true,1,7,"17","B087Z21FXV","hp omen",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,127,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z21FXV","571.50",false,false,false,false,"OMEN 17 Gaming Laptop, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070, Intel Core i7-10750H, 16 GB DDR4 RAM, 512 GB PCIe NVMe SSD, 17.3"" 144Hz Fu...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81nMnhr0iiS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R28PG998HZV73","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2021",4,"Good laptop, but buyer be wary of sellers shipping modified lower-spec models","I bought the HP Omen 15 15-EN-0023DX last year and it's been a great laptop so far. Gaming performance is on par with what I expect out of the GTX 1660 Ti, and the Ryzen 7 4800H is just fantastic. The laptop became my daily driver for most uses, as it outperforms my overclocked Core i7-8086k desktop in everything but gaming.Multi-monitor support is not the greatest: I have 2 4k external monitors, and I have to drive 1 off of DisplayPort and one off of DisplayLink over USB. I could not get DP MST working over the DisplayPort, even though it should be capable of 2x 4k60. I could get them both working via DisplayLink, but DisplayLink has issues with some software (mostly games) so it wasn't viable for me.Major shortcomings of the Omen 15 are a lack of Thunderbolt support (not really surprising since TB is Intel, but nothing prevents HP from putting a TB controller in an AMD laptop), and no support for USB PD. The former is somewhat excusable, but the latter is baffling. Sure, you can deliver more power via the power brick, but outside of gaming, you're never going to exceed the power limits of USB PD. Thunderbolt + USB PD gives single-cable convenience: just plug your laptop into a docking station and you're done. Instead, I have a mess of cables to deal with every time I want to take the laptop with me.In regards to the ""buyer be wary"" bit: I purchased the 15-EN-0023DX, but actually received a 15-EN-0013DX (normally 8GB RAM and 512GB SSD), that the seller had upgraded to match the specs of the 15-EN-0023DX. This went undetected until I sent the laptop in for warranty service with HP, who declined to repair the laptop, since it had 3rd party components in it. I have contacted the seller to address this (no response yet), but the seller should never haver voided the warranty in the first place. Check your serial number with HP to confirm that you indeed have the model you ordered, or you might run into the same problem.",true,1,10,"110","B08G3T3G9X","hp omen",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,93,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G3T3G9X","409.20",false,false,false,false,"HP OMEN | 15-EN0023DX/Gaming 15.6"" Laptop | AMD Ryzen 7/4800H | 16GB DDR4 3200/MHz | 1TB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD | NVIDIA GeForc...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91QgWSxmriL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2L5LINLH80ESR","Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2021",5,"Bang for your buck should be name for this thing.","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. Although I was very wary to make this purchase due to the lack of in-depth photos from OMEN, (like c'mon guys...really?) I got to say I was pleasantly surprised. With a simple sleek design, the omen 30L looks very nice sitting on my desk and has built-in software for the RGB that is actually was a very nice and customizable to set up which is great! **HOWEVER** the cable management is sloppy, to say the least. Packaging was solid and there was no cosmetic or internal damage. And, Omen was nice enough to send the saddest mouse and keyboard I ever did see, but I can respect it for someone who doesn't already have one. (Disclaimer) if your using HDMI to plug into your tv, this rig does not come with a cable in the package!! (it only comes with a power cable) Luckily I already had one on hand.. This surprisingly has a good amount of ports on front and back and accommodated everything I had to plug-in.Starting up was a breeze, the instructions were clear and you will be up and running in less than 15 minutes. For what you pay for you get a pretty powerful machine. Booting up apps and games is not a 5-minute wait. Logging into games usually takes anywhere from a minute to a minute and a half. The geforce rtx 3060 is great and knowing that they are almost impossible to get right now, shows its a steal to get it in this rig. This has no problem running shaders on Minecraft such as BSL, and SEUS at 60 fps in 1080 averaging about 40 degrees celsius for the CPU.Also (Geforce has a built in software that makes checking how your internals are running (fps, cpu temp, ect.) at the touch of a button. Literally alt+z. It is very intuitive and a great add-on. For noise, the fans stay silent but sometimes rise to a dull hum even after running for 8 hours plus, but it really is pretty silent for the most part. For the money and the way pc parts are slim at the moment, I would say this is a pretty good buy. And i never leave reviews but on amazon there are no reviews (another reason I was wary on buying) so I felt I should let the people know whats up. For an average gamer, this thing is a steal and more than enough to handle most games. Im pretty happy with it, although like most reviews, they say the airflow in the case is less than satisfactory, and it is i guess. It hasn't given me any real problems yet, but the top of the case is a grate which should let air through because heat rises right? Wrong, there is another mount for another fan right on the inside of the pc at the very top, blocking airflow, and its has no holes to let air through. SO if you have money left over, you can buy a new case with better air flow or a new fan to mount there. But if your poor and cant afford another fan, you can actually take it out (unscrewing 2 screws) and there are 4 squares in the middle of the mount that with enough force you can pop out and open up a ton of airflow. Or you can just leave the mount out, but I would rather put it back in fear of losing it. AndI know it sounds weird now, but when you see it you will understand. But enough of that. This pc is really awesome for the price, and I brlieve it is worth getting.",true,1,13,"113","B093Y5HFW5","hp omen",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,7,4.8,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Y5HFW5","33.60",false,false,false,false,"HP OMEN 30L- Gaming Desktop - AMD Ryzen 5 5600G (3.90 GHz up to 4.40 GHz) - HyperX 16 GB DDR4-3200 Memory - GeForce RTX 30...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xRgplhvUL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I only keep ONE file on my OneDrive, but it will try to save everything on there if you don’t turn it off or uninstall it at your initial startup.

"R2069A3WQYOPIO","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2021",4,"Great value for money!","I have had this laptop for a few weeks now and I am pleased with the overall product, particularly with its performance. It stays relatively cool and the fans don't get too loud under it's lower power options when not being pushed to do demanding task. Under a heavy load though it can get quite loud as expected(jet engines).As for the battery. It is good when compared to other gaming laptops with the same specs but I wish it were better and able to last the day doing regular task but unfortunately you'll only be able to squeeze around 6 hrs out with continuous use. This is a minor inconvenience to me personally.Lastly, when it comes to this computers design, the keyboard has an excellent feel , the hinges work great and have a good level of resistance preventing any screen wobble. The two biggest problems for me also had to do with design. The sharp edges around the laptop are annoying, while it won't cut you it is noticeably uncomfortable against the wrist while typing. My absolute biggest complaint though, the laptop is not level for some reason, it wobbles when put on flat surfaces and the base appears to be curved (this could just be my model but it annoys the hell out of me).Overall this is a great gaming laptop and one of the best you can get today at it's price point.",true,1,14,"114","B08JVNZJWT","hp omen",true,1324.99,"USD",1449,124.01,8.56,50,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JVNZJWT","235.00",false,true,false,false,"HP - OMEN Gaming 15.6"" Laptop - AMD Ryzen 7 - 8GB Memory - NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti - 512GB SSD - Mica Silver","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91QgWSxmriL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Not sure how well it does with the latest and the greatest though.Overall I'm pretty happy with it, but there is one problem which may annoy some people. Whenever this laptop is on, it emits high pitch audible noise. I initially thought it was the fan noise, but it's present even when the fans are not spinning and sounds like the noise is coming from some power components on the motherboard. I got used to it and don't mind, but I do know a few people who can't take this type of high frequency noise. If you are one of them, please beware!Update: Apr 6, 2021Just after posting my original review, an update was pushed which significantly reduced the high pitch noise coming out of this laptop.

"RTB9AWLRB7F9C","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",3,"Almost","I really had high hopes for this laptop but I found a couple of issues that caused me to return it. First, there was a little bit of backlight bleed on the bottom left side of the screen. While the screen was nice and there was the normal amount of IPS glow, the little white light bleeding through on the bottom left caused me some concern. Although it was not much, it was enough for me to wonder if it would get worse over time. Knowing that there have been some who have complained about screen issues, I did not want to take the chance.Second, the laptop had a few keys that had tactile issues. The #3, #4, and W were not as responsive and springy as the other keys. When I barely moved my fingers across the number row without applying pressure, I could feel that the #3 and #4 keys seemed to be off a little. It worked when typing but I could tell the difference between them and the other keys. The W key was not as bad but you could still feel the difference between it and the Q, E, A, and S. While they may have never caused any issues throughout the life of the laptop, I don't want to take that risk with a $1000+ laptop. I have seen videos and forum posts about this same model where keys are sticking and/or not responding. I did not want to send it to Lenovo for warranty service since I just bought it. Personally, I don't trust a device that has to receive warranty repairs right out of the box. Hopefully, Lenovo can address these issues because this seems like it could be a very great machine.",true,1,1,"10","B08YKG5K7F","hp victus",false,1049.99,"USD",0,0,0,417,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKG5K7F","1876.50",false,false,false,false,"Lenovo Legion 5 15 Gaming Laptop, 15.6"" FHD (1920 x 1080) Display, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H Processor, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB NVMe ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fzx0pGY5L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R6X2MFK0OSG0","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021",2,"Good price for Ryzen 5000 series... However","Ordered this machine as it's the best value for a Ryzen 5000 series CPU which comes with an earlier generation graphics card. (GTX1650). The engineers over at Lenovo took some serious shortcuts with this machine, possibly to encourage consumers to move up to their Legion line. This machine is advertised to allow storage expansion via an open second M. 2 slot, at the expense of the open 2.5"" HDD/SSD bay. You have to choose between them because the second M. 2 slot literally blocks the installation of a 2.5"" drive. There is no work around for this whatsoever. So I decided to do without the 2.5"" bay and I stall a second NVMe, only to see the manufacturer did not install (not include) a standoff for the second SSD. The female threads are there, but no standoff. I immediately called Lenovo and they gave me the part number for the screw pack (which includes the oddly sized standoff) However that part is on back-order and a ship date is unknown. Thankfully some folks on here appear to have received the SSD standoff installed (some machines arrive with it installed in the 2242 position requiring it to be moved to allow 2280) Bit mine arrived with none.So with a brand new 1TB M.2 2280 SSD in hand and no way to install it due to the manufacturer's oversight I initiated a RMA.Coming from last year's Acer Nitro 5, this machine is a definite downgrade. The Acer included all required hardware and their support experience is far above Lenovo. I'm surprised by this as Lenovo is well known for high quality products. But this seems to be true only for their upper end SKU's.I decided to she'll out an extra $200 to go back to the Acer Nitro Series with slightly upgraded specs. IMHO this is well worth the extra cost to avoid future issues with the Lenovo Gaming 3, which is a far lower end machine overall.The cooling on the Lenovo Gaming 3 is another strange engineering fault. It's unclear why they would place the main exhaust literally at the hinge of the laptop's display. In closed position (where many people will have it to use external monitor setup) it blocks roughly 50% of the rear exhaust port by having the lid closed. With the lid open, the extremely hot air is rushed directly towards the bottom half of the display. There is also a second exhaust port which isn't fully utilized by the machine. On Lenovo's high end Legion machines the thermal solution makes sense as the display is moved forward to accommodate. Even with the highly efficient AMD 5600h, this machine gets hot fast. This is another huge oversight by Lenovo on this SKU.But if you don't plan on doing any upgrades or just plan on adding a bit of memory and using the machine as is, this is the cheapest priced Ryzen 5000 with a discrete GPU. If you want full upgradability and a more reliable feature set, it's worth paying $200 more to get the Acer Nitro 5 with a current gen 3060 GPU which allows 3 storage options at once and reliable cooling with it's quad exhaust setup. Lenovo is still a good brand but it's worth paying a bit more now for the Legion model or a Acer Nitro, etc. than settling for this budget offering.",true,1,2,"11","B08YKHGKTV","hp victus",false,699.99,"USD",0,0,0,123,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKHGKTV","541.20",false,false,false,false,"Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15 15.6"" Laptop, 15.6"" FHD (1920 x 1080) Display, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lNj3046jL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R1VONG2FBIEZWN","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2021",5,"Fantastic Value Buy!","I did alot of research prior to my purchase and this deal hands down was the absolute best for my use case. I needed a new laptop for work and with the next gen console nightmare I thought Id get one that can do a bit of intermediate level gaming as well.Firstly the look of most laptops in this price range were a no go for me. The hp pavilion and acer nitro look too ""gamery"" as I carry this to work with me most days. This laptop unlike those looks standard and Lenovo is a brand I've had many positive experiences with before.The speed is lightning quick and I've added an additional 8 gb of ram and a 1tb m.2 ssd which has improved performance even more and covered my one gripe which was the lack of storage. The upgrade itself was pretty easy to do myself.As for the gamimg experience, with only a gtx 1650 you do have to tone down your settings in most titles to come close to capping out your 120hz screen but I'm fine with that. I've attached two pictures of apex legends in the firing range after running around, shooting and using abilities for 5 mins each doing my best to simulate what your in-game experience would be. One picture shows the results at all min settings and the other at all max settings. At all max the fps dips to between 30 to 40 with alot of stuff happening on the screen (bangalore smokes and simultaneous ultimates for example). This isnt really playable in a game where frames matter. At all min you sit at 110 to 130 most of the time with a dip to maybe 70-80 under the conditions I detailed above. The textures are pretty bad however. I've settled on a low-med mix that nets me around 80-90 most of the time. Compared to my ps4 (RIP my next gen ownership ambition btw) this feels amazing. If you want to experience games at their full graphical intensity and dont want to be forced to skimp on visuals look elsewhere but be prepared to pay at least 100% more for a 3060 laptop or at least 30-50% more on a 3050ti laptop.If this is your budget then I DEFINITELY recommend this laptop.",true,1,2,"11","B08YKHGKTV","hp victus",false,699.99,"USD",0,0,0,123,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKHGKTV","541.20",false,false,false,false,"Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15 15.6"" Laptop, 15.6"" FHD (1920 x 1080) Display, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lNj3046jL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

It has met my expectations for performance.Pros:-Speed is excellent-Nice feature set (SD reader!)Cons:-Can get warm during heavier use/charging-Screen brightness is 'meh'I was a little weary of ordering a laptop through Amazon but the price for the config I wanted was hard to argue (could not find a lower price for 16GB/1 TB option anywhere - even if I did it myself). Laptop showed up quickly and has worked great. There is some bloatware, so take some time initially to scrub it. I chose the HP laptop based on reviews and that it was one of the few that actually had a SD card reader. While it seems minor, it is one last peripheral to carry. I use it with Cura frequently and it boots very fast and slices quickly. Light gaming has been speedy and more than sufficient. Battery life is average - not horrible but not great.It can get warmer when charging or gaming. I bought a melamine cutting board to keep my laptop off my lap and have found it to be a low cost option to keep the fan ports unobstructed (not needed for light activities but let's me place it on soft surfaces, etc. without any worries).The screen is probably my only real complaint. It works fine - colors are acceptable and response is fine. It is just not that bright. This is the only reason I have not given this 5 stars.

I used some screen cleaner along with the microfiber towel that came with the laptop to get the majority out, so that was solved.Now as far performance, I spend initial time updating the graphics driver which was easy and noticed that most drivers were up to date which was good.I used 3DMARK to run a check on the processor and Video card. Got the following for CPUMax threads 371716 threads 36658 threads 32884 threads 23682 threads 14191 thread 727And as far as GPU I got a 6287 time spy scoreWhich is higher then a lot of laptop gaming PCs.So the scores were within what you would expect.What was concerning was how hot the cpu temp got during testing. Went over 90 Celsius a good portion of the test while the GPU went to 75 Celsius.I might have to check and see if it’s the thermal paste they used but not sure if I want to mess around either with it.So it is heavy due to the big battery which you would expect from a gaming pc, the fans do their job but you hear them and it gets hot.Performance wise the screen is amazing and gaming on it is awesome. I used it first day to play the new world beta and it looked and played awesome.Very pleased.Update 8/6/21I am moving the laptop from 4 stars to 5Like I mentioned above the laptop gets hot when you play for a long time and I recommend headphones or ear buds while gaming as having the fan to max (by pressing FN and F8(fan key) can be veeeery loud!But the benchmarks I initially posted are low as compared to what I am getting now as I did not have it to the extreme performance on the MSI Dragon Center clicked before. This laptop is a powerhouse!Update 8/10/21:Didn't mention this in my previous review but the ""brick"" or power supply is terrible. With a system like this you end up having to use the power supply alot as the battery drains pretty quickly if your not hooked up. Well the issue is with the cord, the cord is too short.

"R7V4V7Z9N4YJ8","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2021",5,"Nice value and easy to upgrade","I wanted a decently-equipped, lightweight 14-inch laptop to use on the go without breaking the bank and this hit all the notes.I wound up dual-booting it with Pop OS and setup worked well and the 256 GB drive left me more than enough space for a dual install.The memory is partially soldered to the motherboard while another 4 GB stick is replaceable so I swapped that out with an 8 GB one to bump up the system memory to 12 GBs.I believe it can handle up to 20 GB(16 GB stick + 4 GB), and noticed that memory usage in Windows 10 was more stable with the upgrade.That said, 8 GBs is likely more than enough.You can also replace the SSD with another NVMe, though make sure you get the right form factor - it's a 2242 (the smallest one) in case you're looking.But it's quite easy to replace it if you want.I've not tried to stress-test the CPU but I've been able to run a docker image + multiple Chrome tabs + VS code without the fan even kicking on, and my guess is it could handle light-ish gaming as well.For basic office/web/home usage it'll be more than enough.Again, calibrate your expectations but this isn't a bargain-basement device.Screen is solid - it's FHD but at 14 inches you don't see much pixelation and the IPS limits washout from different angles.Brightness is solid as well, though it's certainly not the brightest you'll see.But again, it's good for the price point.And the backlit keyboard has multiple brightness settings depending on the environment.My one big complain is the USB-C port is for data transfer only - no power in or video out.The device has a full-size HDMI port so it's not a deal-breaker but I really would have liked to not have to carry around a device-specific charger.Not a deal breaker but that feels like an unnecessary corner to cut.Still, a good value thus far and I'm happy with how this Ideapad will scale with my needs.",true,1,10,"19","B08YKDYWK5","hp victus",false,629.98,"USD",0,0,0,109,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKDYWK5","490.50",false,false,false,false,"Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U Processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB NVMe TLC SSD Storage, 14.0"" FHD (1920 x 1080)...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K2sPFdi+L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Screen has a beautiful display. RGB Chroma makes it look cool. Most importantly it runs most games out there at 1920 x 1080 resolution on ultra high settings with no noticeable FPS drops. Yes it does get hot when running games at those settings but if you play it in an A/C cooled room, connected to a TV via HDMI, it doesnt get as hot. And its How I always used the laptopThat is also why my review is a 2 Star rating. In less than one year the HDMI port on my laptop stopped working. The computer does detect the TV and lets me assign a resolution for it but theres no display on my TV. Its funny that one should pay over $2000 on a computer for it to start breaking apart in less than a year. After trying litterally every troubleshooting step I could find and contacting Razer they decided I should send the computer for repair. And as of now Im waiting for them to reply to me. Havent heard from them since before yesterday.I will update the review as the story develops. But as of now I could not justify their ultra expensive release prices for their products if they are not even going to outlast the manufacturers warranty.Update 1: Razer will sell their products to Puerto Rico customers. Even on their webise they will ship them to Puerto Rico. Even Best Buy storea in the island sell Razer products. But in case of a warranty claim. If the product needs to be sent for repairs/replacement, it has to be sent first to an address in the USA so it can then be sent to Razer.This might also apply to any US territory.

"R3BBRLYMC7FCZD","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2021",3,"Underwhelming","Purchasing this laptops is another testament to the fact that good specs don't always amount to a great product. I was deciding between the Gigabyte 17"" and a MacBook Pro 16"" and finally picked the AERO because of it's impressive screen and graphics card. Needles to say I'm experiencing buyers remorse.The Bad:Horrible webcam/nosecam: I don't know why Gigabyte decided to even include this monstrosity. It's completely useless as it gives everyone in your Zoom meeting a detailed look up your nostrils. The cam is mounted in the body so it's not adjustable unless you raise the entire laptop. In the world of remote work a good, usable webcam is a MUST. Dishing out 2500 bucks and realizing that you still need to by an additional webcam to mount on your screen is a joke. GIGABYTE PLEASE FIX.Charging port: It’s located on the right, middle of the laptop which interferes with your mouse, if you have a tight space and are right-handed. Most coffee shops I go to have tiny tables and given the size of this 17.3” laptop there’s very little room.Battery life: I’m a graphic designer that works in 3D occasionally. When I use Photoshop/Illustrator and Dimension I can’t get more than 1 hour of battery life out of this thing even in power saver mode.Screen changes brightness: Yes, it will go darker or lighter without you touching any settings. Not the end of the world, but annoying.Screen goes black: I’ve used this laptop for a month and so far I’ve had at least 5 instances where the screen goes completely black for a second or two. Gigabyte WTF?Annoying keyboard: I’m used to Macs where to change volume you hit F11 or F12. In this thing you have to hold down the Function key in order to adjust volume, so it becomes a two handed operation. I find this really annoying as volume setting is something that is the most adjusted function and needs to be as intuitive as possible.RGB keyboard: This is a Creator’s laptop not a “gamer” laptop. Having the keyboard pulse like a rainbow on acid is not only distracting but also extremely tasteless. If you want to compete with Macbooks please get rid of this gimmick that appeals to 12 year olds.Now the Good:This thing is fast.The screen is beautiful.The GPU kicks ass. It’s 10 times (10!) faster at rendering 3D than my 13” Macbook pro.It’s relatively slim and not too cheesy looking (minus the RGB keyboard) which fortunately you can turn off.About $2500 cheaper than a similarly spec’d out Mac. Mac’s however have better ergonomics.Ports. Useful, but because of its shortcomings I have to use up one USB port for an external cam and another for a mouse. So it’s a mixed bag.Summary:This laptop is good if you keep it plugged in all the time and use it like a desktop. Hauling it around and working on the go is not a real option as you only have about an hour.

This laptop cold boots in 7-10 seconds. It can easily do heavy load multitasking (even with the 16GB Ram). I'm not a real gamer, so I cant comment on that. However for Photoshop, Autocad and 4k movie editing this laptop has way more then enough power to handle.The fact that this has 4k HDR display is crazy to me. This display is literally breathtaking. The HDR is ""Entry level HDR"" so it's not like my TV but to have this on my laptop pictures/videos looks amazing!(1 month update)This laptop after a month is perfect!, I only ran into one issue after installing GEFORCE EXPERIENCE... it causes random BSOD. Unistalling it fixed everything.I did one additional upgrade to 64gb RAM. The 16gb that comes with is probably good enough for the average user.. but I'd recommend atleast upgrading it to 32gb eventually.It is very quite when doing websearching, youtube watching, Autocad or even video/photo editing.When my son used it for minecraft, you can start hearing the fans spin after the laptop starts heating up.... nothing too loud though.(2 Month Update, Final update unless something happens)So after using it for a couple months I realized when using the Laptop on battery once in a while the screen would flash black randomly. This is easily fixed by updating the Intel graphics driver to the newest (As of this review the newest version is: 30.0.100.9805).One more thing for people that have problems with the keyboard settings not staying... update the Gigabyte Control Panel.

Must see it in person to believe how good it looks.The processor is the absolute latest, fastest 8 core (16 thread) processor from Intel. It has the latest Gen 4 PCI-Express, supporting the FASTEST NVME drives and Thunderbolt 4 peripherals in on the market. This is huge for speed of devices attached, and future-proofs the laptop since this technology is new.It comes with a blazing fast boot drive. It's a PCIe Gen4 OEM 500GB Samsung 980 Pro. I am surprised this isn't mentioned anywhere. I only know because I opened the laptop and looked under the hood. This drive has nearly 6,800MBps of read speed(!) Fast as it gets!This is your serious daily-driver work laptop by day, RGB Goofball by night (if that's your thing). Gorgeous modern metallic body with nothing screaming GAMERRR.Putting this guy under heavy stress and I saw internal PEAK temperatures reach about 75C, yet the laptop itself was lukewarm at best thanks to nice cooling.I/O and Connectivity Galore. USB-C Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, Mini Display AND Wi-fi 6? Check.This Laptop is a combination of awesome little details that build to ""Almost Perfect"". I could be talking about it all day long and it wouldn't be enough. Definitively recommended and a Winner in my personal opinion. Did I mention anything about the OLED?--- Cons ---It's a RTX 3080 with 105W of power. Seriously Gigabyte? The new ""Gamer-Focused"" Aorus 15P has 130W and this professional content creator gets stuck with just 105W? Maybe I'm just being petty.The Webcam angle is... depressing at best (it's positioned at the top of the keyboard, aiming up). At least I will know if I have BOOGERS during an online conference.The charging port is at the right side of the laptop. For more constricted work spaces like mine, it does rob valuable space to where the mouse could glide.The ""Gigabyte Control Center"" is good in concept, but bad in execution. It would be great if it didn't fail to remember keyboard lighting settings. Also the ""AI tuner"" banner pop-up is super annoying. It displays on screen every time you switch an application. And like the keyboard lighting, turning it ""off"" only does so until you reboot the computer. Once rebooted you must turn them it again. Annoying. I hope they fix this with an update.That's it. These are the only complaints I actually have of this guy in about a month of ownership.--- Overall Review ---This laptop is the latest money can buy. Has everything one could ask for and more.

It's not perfect, but it runs great, looks good doing it, and won't burn you.2021 09 30 Update at the bottom.The Pros:*Very powerful CPU/GPU*Outstanding cooling system. So far the Aero 15 is running at least 20C cooler than my previous machine. Stock temps in the mid 40s, mid-high 70s under heavy load. I'd be surprised if I ever see this machine thermal throttling in anything remotely like a normal use case. Unlike my previous machine that would regularly hit 95C gaming. (see update about fan quality below)*The best looking screen I have ever seen on a laptop. Every other screen I have looks bland and washed out compared to this glorious 4k OLED. Pictures and reviews I've seen just don't convey how amazing it really looks.*Very good build quality overall.*Bright LED keyboard with a full numpad (fully customizable). Feels better than most laptop keyboards too.*2 RAM and SSD slots are easily accessible by removing the bottom plate (just one set of screws). Also got a thermal pad for a second SSD included in the box.*Built in sliding webcam cover. No need for tape on this one.*So. Many. Ports.The Cons:*The OLED screen is 60 hz. 4k 60 fps is great for most gaming scenarios, but I'd avoid this laptop if you absolutely need ultra high framerates, or want to play twitchy competitive shooters like CS or Valorant where more frames literally win games. The upside is that you can up the GFX settings more than on a higher refresh screen and still get the most out of it.*The OLED screen is not anti glare. There may be a technical reason for that, but regardless, avoid using this in bright areas, or while wearing any reflective clothing. It's reflective enough to be a decent mirror when turned off.*16GB of RAM isn't enough for a machine this powerful. Mine came stock with 2x8GB 3200 Crucial branded chips. They seem to be good RAM, just not big enough. It runs much better with 32GB 3200 HyperX installed. Can support up to 64, so there's room to improve when prices come down.*The built in webcam sucks, to be blunt. It's fairly low quality and poorly positioned. If you need a good webcam, hook up an external, there's more than enough ports to go around.*Gigabyte's Control Center software is a clunky mess, although it does have some useful features. Still not a fun experience using it though.*Unable to undervolt the CPU. This is more about newer chips than this laptop in particular, but I haven't found a way to do it safely.*The screen hinges are a bit weird. It's not loose or flimsy, but the screen can wobble a bit more than what I'd expect.*The function keys are horribly designed. The secondary function of each key is not illuminated, making it very hard to see in the dark. Sleep and Wifi are right next to screen brightness controls, and brightness up is on f4. I'm sure somebody has ruined their day by hitting the wrong button trying to change brightness. The fn key for keyboard brightness is the spacebar, and only has off, 'bright' and 'super bright' settings. For anything in between you need to use the software.*Built in speakers are mediocre. They're not too bad, but like the webcam, they feel like a cut corner compared to the higher quality of the rest of this system.Edit: A few observations after 3 months of use:* Gigabyte really cut corners on the fans. The cooling system works as well as I initially thought it did, but the fans themselves are low quality and wear out quickly. My GPU fan is already starting to wear out and produce irritating excess noise. There's no actual performance loss from it so far, but I've ordered a replacement fan.Dropped a star from 5 to 4 because of this, since after a bit of research it's been a persistent problem with the Aero series for years and remains unfixed by Gigabyte. This is the last place you want to use cheap parts. Inexcusably bad on a product that does so many things right.* I disassembled the Aero 15 for the first time to oil the GPU fan while I wait for the replacement, and I absolutely love the interior design. It's so well thought out and easy to tear down to clean or repair. The heatsink has numbered retained screws, and there are fewer screws than I'm used to seeing in general. Also no easy to break ribbon cables in sight. The downside, again with the fans, is that you have to remove the entire heatsink to access them, so I had to repaste as well.*Oiling the GPU fan reduced the noise it was making by about 80%. This isn't a long term fix, but it does treat the symptoms. Note that this is NOT something the typical end user should be attempting to do. If you aren't confident about your ability to open up a laptop this could be a much bigger problem that requires an RMA, and from what I've heard Gigabyte RMA is a horrible experience.*Also worth mentioning since I tried it, this laptop does not run well with Linux on bare metal. Maybe somebody more experienced with Linux could get it running good, but I couldn't. Stick to VMs or WSL if you need Linux on this machine.",true,1,5,"14","B093Z1JLHT","laptop gigabyte aero",true,2246.17,"USD",2999,752.83,25.1,10,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z1JLHT","42.00",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 15 OLED YD - 15.6"" UHD 4k AMOLED IPS, Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, 16GB RAM,...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pZxA3UiRS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

(You can't access the ports on the right if the power cable is facing frontwards.)2) The RGB per-key lighting is beautiful BUT the secondary characters (i.e., when you hit Shift) like for the lighting, sound and even common characters like ( ) @ # $ % on the number row do not light up -- they are not backlit! The problem (via Reddit) is that the Omron switches -- which have excellent tactile feel and travel -- have center lighting only. All right, but the printed secondary characters are done in a wispy light gray which you absolutely cannot see in the dark. (This is a poor design choice here.) They should be near white -- or at least reflect the light of the keys a bit. I just couldn't use this as a developer at night -- you'll need a separate light on to write / program at night. Of course, if you are a good typist, it doesn't matter for the common characters, but for the lighting, sound and other functions you aren't likely to know them by 'muscle memory.')Otherwise, an excellent laptop, but these are two hands-on gotchas you might not notice till you try this out this system in real life.",true,1,6,"15","B07SFR748X","laptop gigabyte aero",true,1599,"USD",1899,300,15.8,212,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFR748X","890.40",false,false,false,false,"Gigabyte AERO 15 OLED Thin and Light Laptop, 15.6 Thin Bezel UHD AMOLED Panel, i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX1660Ti,16GB RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NW5PsqpuL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I’m running the Aero 15 with RTX 2060, i7 9750, and OLED screen.The screen is about as crisp as you can get and the hardware works great together. After I bought the laptop I read a few negative reviews that got me worried. Some of them spoke about the fans being loud. Yes the fans will ramp up while gaming but it’s not a bad thing if you want cool hardware. I’ve heard no “coil whining” and had no issues with the WiFi. If you have issues with this computer it can most likely be fixed by tweaking the firmware and downloading drivers. If you are not at all tech savvy but still want to buy this computer because of the quality the first thing I would do is take it to a friend or someone that can find all the drivers for you and make all the adjustments needed to get this thing working to it’s potential, because once it’s optimized there’s no stopping it. Everything about this laptop screams “Cool”. From the way it runs, to the looks of the screen, the keyboard, and the logo on the back of the screen. The placement of the camera isn’t an issue if you don’t care about the views from your webcam, which I don’t. As far as gaming goes, I’ve run COD Black Ops Cold War (Multiplayer and Main Story) and No Mans Sky, both of which have worked great. May have to lower the video settings in the game itself to get the FPS up but it’s possible to run games at 70 FPS.

I am happy with the 16 GB of ram and the 1 TB gen 4 SSD.For others who need more storage, the presence of the 2nd gen 3 SSD slot is a big plus. I expect this laptop to serve me well for long time. I guess I can love and still be aware of misses. As of this moment, I am still flipping on giving a 4 or 5 rating.A 4.5 would be comfortable for me to give.But then again my perfect laptop would have to be 6 stars. LOL.I decided to move this support warning from the bottom of the text to the top, because it really bothers that I cannot register the laptopSUPPORTI am perplexed. I have been trying to register the laptop for weeks now.Every link I have tried fails with most common error being 502 Bad Gateway. Does not matter which browser I try and have tried from multiple desktops and laptops. I have bought motherboards and graphics cards from them in the past. So I am surprised and disappointed that they no longer FULLY support their products.These are their own links imbedded in their own web pages.Yeah I expect they are going to reply, Don’t worry, we cover it etc. …… I understand that with Gigabyte being hacked, the company may be distracted from maintaining the business. It reflects badly upon the company.SCREENI love the 4k screen with its high resolution so I can have plenty of open windows and because of the crisp text I can still clearly read data. Basically I can lay panels out on the 15 inch screen like I would for my 27 inch monitor and still read just as well.Most people won’t care but data hogs will be happy. (if you are one, you will know what I am talking about.) Being a 4K screen, Windows will be “suggesting” a 250% scaling which I have dialed back so I can fit more on the display. I have not found any flaws in my display such as dead pixels or backlight issues or bleed. Movies are gorgeous, crisp and bright BUT there is a but.. see section on speakers.KEYBOARDVery Decent. A bit of concave shaping helps center fingers. The little locator bars on the J & F help touch typing and a light bit of bounce and key travel helps.Better than keyboard on my old asus . About equal to my old old Toshibabut not quite as nice of the feel of my Lenovo TabX1. A Plus for the AERO, there a real 10 key pad (sadlylacking on the TabX1 due to size). The backlighting is a BIG plus. I have used the control center to zone the colors and brightness for alphanumeric, function keys, control keys and the ten keys.Whoever decided to NOT include the shifted characters for the backlight needs to be wacked up the side of the head. Duh… Guess I will have to keep a flashlight with me at night.SPEAKERSBluntly barely adequate. The listening environment has to be totally quiet.If there is noise such as a fan in the room then the Volume on every setting from Windows, to the player or video application has to be at maximum. I tried to watch a movie and had to turn off a room fan (it’s August).While I couldhear strongly spoken dialogue, anything whispered was totally lost and I had no idea of what was said. Gigabyte brags “DTS:X Ultra Immerse yourself In Cinema Grade Sound” So external speakers or headphones are going to be needed. Hooking up a good Bluetooth speaker solved the problem for the movie.DOCUMENTATIONNot as good as my prior Gigabyte experiences. When I found the manual on the hard drive I thought I was in good shape.Nope, it was just a soft copy of the 2 page quick start guide.So online you will go hunting.Some specifications are there on the sales portion of the Gigabyte site. I am making a offline copy of the Gigabyte info, just in case they delete the info. Then there are a few third party review sites that cover technical data for the laptop.NOSE CAMIf you have already read or watched the reviews available, you already know the camera placement and quality are such a mess that Gigabyte could have and should have done better right at the beginning of the design and layout planning.I knew about it before I ordered and I will never ever use it. A total waste.",true,1,7,"16","B093Z3NPDQ","laptop gigabyte aero",false,1999,"USD",0,0,0,23,3.9,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z3NPDQ","89.70",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 15 OLED XD - 15.6"" UHD 4k AMOLED IPS, Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, 16GB RAM,...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pZxA3UiRS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Great screen, excellent specifications for this price, easy upgrades. But when my new laptop arrived it has green hue on the left bottom corner of the screen. I contacted Amazon Customers service and after they were unable to help me they sent me to Gigabyte customer service.Gigabyte e-support answered only after a week and after I sent them pictures they redirected me to their warranty service. So I left RMA request with description of my problem and waited for two days for respond (24-48 hour their usual respond time). But when I tried to check status of my request, I was unable to do that because all of their services went down after ransomeware attack. And they still down for more than 2 weeks.Then I again contacted Amazon Customer service and asked for replacement, which they sent right away ( Thank you, Amazon customer service workers!)BUT! Instead of Aero 15 XD I got Aero 15 KD, which is cheaper version with lower specs, such as 3060 gpu vs 3070 gpu and 512gb SSD/1tb SSD. And it looks like wrong laptop was sent from Gigabyte. I had actual laptop package inside of Gigabyte shipping box with shipping label to Amazon with correct model name on it, but with different model inside.

I've had this laptop for a little over three months now and have now started getting the dreaded BLUE SCREEN! This is my work laptop and so I don't use it for any personal gaming/activities. This is pretty disappointing considering the fact how expensive it is.Changing my 2 stars to 1. Would give it half a star if I could. Ultimately it's your money and your choice but my suggestion is DO NOT BUY!So the main reason that I got this laptop because I needed a work computer with a long battery life. I have a desktop for all my gaming needs. When i first received the laptop, I noticed that the seal was already coming off, as I was excited about the laptop itself I just brushed it off as perhaps shipping issue. As I turned it on and got everything set up, I was pounded with notification to download a bunch of things that I didn't need or seemed fishy. I opted to just reset the laptop and delete everything. Hopefully it hasn't been tempered with....I've had the laptop for two weeks now and I have to say that I am quite disappointed with it. The feature that I was looking forward to most which was the long battery life does not live up to what it says. I get maybe 3-4 hours at most with a full charge with just watching youtube/prime movies and doing some work. I haven't tested out the gaming capacity side of this laptop yet so I can't comment on that too much but I did try running two instances of Bluestacks at low settings and it lagged both of them pretty hard. It handled one instances okay.So overall the laptop itself works fine, however the reason why I bought it was for the battery life and it doesn't live up to what it claims about it's long battery life.",true,1,11,"110","B07BSXCCHK","laptop gigabyte aero",false,1288.33,"USD",0,0,0,340,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07BSXCCHK","1394.00",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE Aero 15X v8-BK4 15"" Ultra Slim Gaming Laptop 144Hz IPS Anti-Glare FHD Display, i7-8750H, GeForce GTX 1070, 16G RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81siTtZm9QL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R38LHS14QQ6IY5","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2021",1,"Fantastic... if it Worked","I bought this back in February, and the 4K OLED screen is amazing, the graphical performance is better than I've had in other laptops, and the cooling seems to do a decent job at keeping the machine from thermal throttling too much. High-speed hardware and a great price for one of the few laptops with a 4K display, let alone a nice OLED one.Unfortunately, every time I try to play a game on it with a second SSD installed, it'll decide to cut my internet speed down by 90% or more, if it even stays connected to the Internet in the first place. On top of that, it'll sporadically disconnect from any peripherals I use with it, including mice, headsets, external keyboards, wired or wireless, it'll get dropped if that second hard drive is in there.I've already sent it in once, and when I got it back and the issue showed up again after only a couple of days, I tried to troubleshoot it more myself so I could provide Gigabyte with more information. However when I went to try and submit a second RMA request, I found my login information was suddenly not on file, even though I've already sent it back to them once. No big deal, seeing as I can make a fresh account and go from there, right?Wrong. Now the serial number that was fine before is registering in a different country, and I cant get my RMA request processed regardless.If you're getting this for streaming or for business, you should be fine. But if you're looking for a great new gaming laptop, this thing will make you regret buying it.Seeing as it's still under warranty, I'm still trying to get this laptop either replaced or my money back. But seeing as their tech support is apparently so swamped that they can't get to me in a timely manner or bother their specialists to actually call me back, and submitting an e-ticket usually takes a week or more to hear back, I'm hoping this review gets their attention and we can get this problem solved once and for all.All I can really say is buyer beware.

It looks and feels like a professional's machine, not a gamer's toy, so it fits into any kind of working environment. Aluminum chassis, sleek black design, no excessive RGB lighting.It has a lot of useful ports and little need for dongles. The two USB-Cs were a nice touch. One of them will fast-charge my cellphone, which is a huge plus for me when on the go.The POWER of this machine is awesome. Even though its light and small, it can run VR games at full FPS, supports raytracing, and can run Unity, Slack, Visual Studio, 24 VNC clients and compile video at the same time. Can't believe this thing's got an i9 AND an RTX 2070 for under $2k. Be wary though: when this thing gets going, it gets HOT. You can't do real work / gaming on your lap, and I nearly burned myself touching the underside when I needed to move it.I haven't really tested the battery that well, but I did manage to do some off-and-on video editing / web browsing for about 4-5 hours before needing to charge. But as you should know, that kind of battery life is not going to last for long.The only problems I've had, other than its hot-to-the-touch underside, is the pre-installed software. As a tech pro, I'm okay with handling some of the hiccups, but others might have problems. First, the ""A.I."" it has installed is handy at times, an annoyance at others. You can read about it elsewhere, but my two cents: It's really cool how it handles power regulation for different apps so you don't have to. I was also pleasantly surprised when it changed my keyboard lighting based on what game I was playing, all automatically. However, the program is a bit CPU intensive, and it will override settings that you don't want it to touch, so you'll have to configure it accordingly; however, I usually just turn it off 100% to avoid fiddling with settings and to get some CPU utilization back.Most of the pre-installed software is just no use to me at all, and usually just cause annoyances. These can be easily uninstalled, but if you like a crystal clean machine upon purchase so you don't have to do anything (which doesn't really exist for current PC's anyway), you're gonna have a bad time.Also the camera is bad, but pretty on-par as far as laptop PC cameras go. I never use it, so it's fine for me.BOTTOM LINE: if you're thinking about getting a Razor Blade or an Alienware m15, seriously consider getting this.

It completely bogs down the entire system, making watching videos, playing games, and navigating Windows pretty much impossible. Super laggy.After speaking with support it was clear they were not going to be any help. They recommended I reinstall the Gigabyte control center (lol) and ""update"" the drivers. (Update in quotes because most of the recommended drivers from the control center were old and out of date, including the Nvidia drivers.)Be aware that support for this laptop will be non-existent.I did a full wipe and reinstall of windows to see if maybe all the garbage software Gigabyte installed was causing the issues, but, nope. HDR is broken on this computer.As far as the internals, as long as HDR is off, this will rip though any game you throw at it on ultra settings, and the screen is still pretty. Only 60hz refresh rate though.I bought this computer because I wanted a mobile 3070 chip and a 17 inch screen. For those reasons it works, so I'm not super disappointed.

"R2URBAA8W6BNAL","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020",1,"Terrible Fan Issues and Customer Support","Bought this laptop to use for college and games, and was extremely happy at first. After about 3 months of normal use, the GPU fan starting making an awful grinding sound. After getting to school, the fan eventually stopped working completely, causing the laptop to overheat and crash when doing things as simple as web browsing. Communicating with Gigabyte took 3 or more days between responses, and ended with having to pay $100 in shipping due to the warranty being limited, not full. It took nearly a two weeks (aside from shipping times) for a simple fan replacement that would likely take a technician no longer than an hour. During this time I had to work out getting a temporary laptop to use for school, which was an ordeal in and of itself.After receiving the laptop for the second time, it worked perfectly and I was once again happy. It is now 1 year later, and the other fan just died. The warranty only lasts a year, so it's up by now. I could easily do the replacement myself, but Gigabyte is stingy with their parts and I can only find a replacement fan from a third party for $85, which is far higher than the actual value of the part. After lots of research last year and this year, this seems to be a relatively common problem with the Aero 15 series in general. Despite loving the laptop when it works, this experience has prompted me to never want to buy a product from Gigabyte again.Don't be optimistic, don't be fooled by the generally good specs, don't take a risk, and don't waste your money; a laptop of this price should absolutely not have problems as simple as these, with such poor customer support to back it up.

"R3BKYEQS6DWVN1","Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2020",3,"Rough edges overwhelm an intriguing idea","When I was looking to purchase a new laptop in early-mid 2019, my desired features were for it to be relatively thin and light while still holding a discrete graphics card, have a Thunderbolt 3 port (or more), and ideally have a monitor with good color reproduction.My intended use was primarily for gaming, but I was also looking for a portable workstation for photo and video editing.Unfortunately, most Windows laptops don't have Thunderbolt, end of.Of the few that did, most had only one, and often it was only available on models with lower-end processors and/or no discrete graphics card.And even the tiny number that checked those boxes generally had TN panels with limited color accuracy.So my selection was fairly limited.The AERO 15 seemed to have (most) of the specs I was looking for.And the new line had OLED displays that promised superb color accuracy.While the price was certainly higher, it had the best combination of size, weight, processor/GPU, and monitor available.Plus it had two M.2 slots for PCIe SSDs (another rarity), and seemed to be user upgradeable with relative ease, which was important given that the models available paired memory and SSD upgrades with faster processors and GPUs.Sadly, reality is much harsher.The problems started immediately.I had read that the AERO series could be finicky about the RAM it took.So after extensive research and finding lists of apparently compatible RAM on various forums (absolutely no official statement from Gigabyte, only supposedly official lists of compatible RAM provided by tech support and posted on forums), I selected a set that seemed to offer the best price/performance ratio for the range in which I was looking, and ordered it at the same time.After booting the laptop up the first time to confirm it worked, I powered it off, flipped it over, and began the laborious process of removing all 12 screws from the backplate.It took a bit of work with a spudger, but the backplate came off to reveal a fairly good arrangement of internals.It was a bit disconcerting to find that the thermal pad on the SSD had been folded in application and was mostly just scrunched up between the end of the SSD and the backplate.But nevertheless, it was easy enough to pop out the stock DIMM and replace it with my new paired set.Screwing everything back together, I plugged in the power, hit the power key, and...nothing.The laptop would not post.So out with the screws again (that was dumb), off with the backplate, double check that everything is seated properly, and nothing.One more attempt for good measure, and I decide to swap back to the original DIMM to make sure everything should work.Yup, no problem.So I spent several hours over that night and the next day trying to get my RAM replacement to work.I had a partial success fairly early on, when I got it to post with the original stick (8 GB Samsung) and and one of the new ones (16GB Corsair).Of course, it was then running both DIMMs at the slower speed of the Samsung, and there was no reason I should run a mismatched pair.So I pulled the Samsung and put in the other Corsair, and was right back to the black screen of futility.Eventually, I gave up.Some of that was forced, because I'm pretty sure I fried the Samsung DIMM by accidentally hotplugging it.How was it an accident?Well I forgot another fun feature of this laptop.It won't shut off.See it refused to post with the Corsair memory, but it still powered up, spun the fans, all that jazz.And when it didn't post, I'd hold down the power button to force it to shut down, and it would.And then, sometime in the next few seconds, it would start up again.And I was impatient, and wanted my relatively expensive laptop to work, so I didn't disconnect or discharge the battery, and I wasn't quite fast enough in swapping DIMMs before it powered on again.So I discharged the battery overnight, tried again the next day in every combination I could think of, and gave up and ordered a pair of the same model of Samsung memory it had come with.When the memory arrived, I inserted it, flipped the laptop over, hit the power button, and it was fine.Actually I think it made my heart sink by not posting the first time, but at the second attempt, it booted fine and I've never had an issue with not booting due to RAM since.Which brings me to the experience of using it.It's...fine.Gigabyte packages it with several control panels that are supposed to make customizing everything and getting the most out of it a breeze.From other reviews I read, this is a bit hit or miss, and it mostly just got in my way when I didn't actually want to make changes.It is a nice package - mostly black, no gaudy trim with the exception of the faux-chrome ""AERO"" plate between the rear heatsinks, and while it does have a giant AERO logo in LEDs on the lid, at least they're white.I had/have no complaints about the speed, though I haven't really pushed it.The fans are loud when they rev up, which is most of the time, though that's partly due to my leaving it on a fairly aggressive cooling setting.Crapware is mostly nonexistant (except for the unavoidable Windows stuff).But it's not just the firmware that has quality problems.The hardware also apparently has iffy quality control, as I've discovered today when my GPU fan bearings failed.Even if Gigabyte would still honor the warranty (if it even still falls in the warranty period), their RMA process is infamously bad, with every forum discussing issues with Gigabyte full of posts about a complete lack of communication from customer support.So where do I go from here?Would I recommend this version, or a newer one, or would I buy a Gigabyte laptop again?I'm not sure.When it was working, I quite liked it.But, purely anecdotally, every other laptop I've owned has just worked.I didn't have the stress of wondering if I had just sunk thousands of dollars into a fancy paperweight with other brands, just because my memory wasn't on a super secret list of four models (not even just brands; specific models) that would work.While they've worn out and/or gotten slower, that was after three or four years of hard use, not one.And I have no confidence that, if there had been a serious problem during the warranty period and I had wanted to return or get it fixed, that I would have had any success doing so.So I guess the tl;dr is:If you do plenty of research about the specific model you're looking to buy to find out exactly what parts you can use to upgrade it, and if you're willing to fly solo and/or with the help of random (helpful and kind) people on the internet, and if you're ok gambling that you won't have any major part fail quickly (but not so quickly it can be warrantied), then yeah, go ahead and get this (or a similar) laptop from Gigabyte.But if not, then I'd say it's worth whatever tradeoff there may be in increased price (potentially Razer) or slightly worse specs (Dell, several other brands) is probably worth it to avoid a brand and line that has so many issues.",true,1,16,"115","B07SHJXNBL","laptop gigabyte aero",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,78,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SHJXNBL","288.60",false,false,false,false,"Gigabyte AERO 15 OLED SA-7US5020SH 15"" Thin Bezel Samsung UHD Amoled, i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, Samsung 8GB RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51eTChBKn5L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"RLYM6JSCU21O0","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2020",4,"One of the best gaming laptops I have used","The laptop itself is amazing. It is sleek, sturdy, and well built. The one thing I would say that bugs me about the design would be the camera location. But, of course, if you want no bezel, you need to put the camera somewhere, and a camera down there is better than no camera. The access to the internals is pretty easy but you need a T6 screwdriver to access it. The main problem with this laptop would be the detection of memory. I bought the 16 GB memory variant but I wanted to take it to the max with 64 GB. However, I found out how hard this is very soon. The BIOS has a very hard time recognizing what ram is put in. For example, if I were to take out the existing ram and put it back in, it had problems booting up; I would be met with a black screen that keeps running the fans on high. If I were to try to force shut it down, it would just turn back on. Which made it pretty damn hard to swap ram as I was afraid offring the entire laptop. I just had to keep taking it out and putting it back in for it to recognize the ram and now I am set with 32GB and I gave up on putting the other 32 in there for a while. I have submitted a ticket. will update on how that goes.

Performance is good, but there's one MASSIVE CATCH.THERMALS were terrible, sitting around 52 *C on IDLE and upwards of 90 *C under load. Fans were ALWAYS running and very loud.I was about to return this until I tried to manually adjust a few things as a last effort (through Windows Apps only, I did not touch any hardware stuff since that may impact the Warranty/Return Policy). I have this laptop for only a few days, so take this with a grain of salt. I'll try to update if something comes up.First, you need to finish all of your Windows Updates.Then download Gigabyte Control Center from Gigabyte website if you don't have it already. Update every driver available through there. Then here's the tricky part. Refer to online threads (aka Google search) if you are not familiar.1) Go to Nvidia Control Center. Under Manage 3D Setting, change Power Management Mode to Adaptive.2) Open an app called Intel Extreme Tuning Utility (should be installed along with Windows Update, but download if you need to). Undervolt CPU Core and CPU Cache by 100 mV (-0.100 V). Decrease Graphics Ratio Limit by 2 units.3) Go to Control Panel > Hardware and Sound > Battery Options > Change plan settings (recommend do this for all options) > Change advanced power settings > Processor power management > minimum processor rate. Change all values to 0 or 1 %.4) Restart your PC.5) Go to Gigabyte Control Center again. Using the lowest CPU slider option and on Quite Mode in Device Setting, the laptop should run ~40-45 *C on idle, and fans should not be running when using typical web browsing/Office apps.When under load (playing games, video editing, etc.) changes above should not have noticeable effects on performance. It's a pity that the laptop doesn't come with these settings automatically, but this is the work you have to do if your unit has problems like mine.

"R2MB0QYIC1C4K1","Reviewed in the United States on January 18, 2020",2,"Not for casuals. Seriously.","If I weren't technically inclined I would be utterly heartbroken over this purchase. If all you do is edit photos and tinker around on the internet - it's fine but this laptop is marketed to power users. If you game in any capacity, do a lot of video rendering or anything that comes close to maxing cpu loads then you will absolutely thermal throttle 100% of the time. This laptop requires use of Throttlestop and the know-how to set it up. You cannot use intel XTU. After setting it to max out at 3.8-3.9 Ghz and setting a -150mv undervolt it now barely ever breaks mid 70 degrees Celsius. Before it would it 90 degree before a games splash screen was loaded. It was that bad. 4.0ghz seems to be the tipping point before heat skyrockets.Next, a few weeks ago the gpu fan started making crunching sounds and then go silent. I opened the monitoring utility and saw that when it went silent that it was actually turning off. The fan was trying to start and puttering out. I had to disassemble everything to get to the fans and take it apart to oil it after 2 months of ownership! The entire inside was spotless but it seems that bad fans are pretty common and other people have had to send their computers away. NOPE! Not this guy. Cost me 7 bucks because I had to repaste the CPU and GPU over a freaking bad fan - thank god the motor still had power. I just thought the cute little guy liked to chirp at me from time to time. Didn't know it was a time bomb.Next, RAM. Just buy Samsung. Don't do anything else. Other motherboards will let you mix brands - hell even frequencies. This one is a picky eater.So with that being said, where else are you going to get a laptop this BEAUTIFUL and UNIQUE? This product once the bugs are sorted is an absolute joy. The GPU now easily overclocks 100mhz (MSI Afterburner) and runs neck in neck with the desktop version with (now) great thermals and frames.

Needless to say I was nervous about getting a Laptop.having an issue with the laptop after only a week of use only made me have buyers remorse. Thankfully tho Computer Upgrade Kings with Amazon worked with me on figuring out the problem with the laptop and got a replacement in just a few days.I am not sure what the problem was exactly with the laptop.

The Laptop was overheating and crashing during the boot cycle.The new Laptop is working very well, good battery life @ ~ 6 hours gaming time with the GPU at max.It does run warm while plugged in but not past 75C. It will run cooler while under battery power. I believe this is because it dials down the power consumption.

"R7QPN8MJ2KBUX","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2018",3,"Overpowered and Unneccessary (A 1 year Later Review)","The Aorus X5 V7, laptop does it's job, with an i7-7820HQ CPU and full size GTX 1070 with 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, it smashes the most demanding games on the max graphics, such as The Witcher 3, The Division, Arma 3, and the new Black Ops 4.While it does accomplish it's job, there are a lot of unnecessary features that make me regret purchasing this laptop when it was $2500. (As of 9/18/18, it is $1799.00 on Amazon).The Unnecessary Features/ Negatives1) You don't need the Overclockable CPU, it's not worth the extra processing speed, and contributes to the laptop's overall heat (this laptop runs 80-90 degrees Celsius normally with AAA games).2) You don't need the 3K, 2880 x 1620 pixels screen resolution. On a 15.6 inch screen, one can't tell the difference between 1080p and 1620p resolutions with most games. (Running it on a higher resolution just contributes to the heat anyway)3) The Screen is only a 59.97 Hz refresh rate, meaning that the max FPS you can get is 60 with any game, this seems a bit counter intuitive when you have a 3K resolution screen, and a full size GTX 1070 graphics card. The laptop does have G-Sync capabilities which does help when you have a screen that is capped at 60 FPS, but one would rather have a 144 Hz refresh screen than one with the extra cost added on because of G Sync and higher resolution.4) The laptop runs REALLY HOT, on most modern AAA games, the laptop (When using MSI Afterburner) clocks temperatures of 80-90 degrees Celsius. Which makes the laptop unable to be played on a lap, unless you want to scald yourself, I even bought a laptop cooler, which doesn't help much at all. The keyboard even gets so hot, it's at time unbearable to be playing on it, even on a desk.- The added processing power of the i7-7820HQ processor just adds too much heat to the compact design of this laptop. And now that there are the 8th gen CPUs out, the 7820HQ is just obsolete.- Even the power brick gets hot to the touch. Recommending you leave it somewhere away from your feet.5) The laptop within a couple days of delivery, would randomly shut down ( no BSOD), just a random freeze for about 5 seconds, then a full shutdown. Assuming related to the heating issues, there's no error message so there's no way to tell).6) After a year and a couple weeks ( The warranty is only for a YEAR by the way), I started to get awkward BSODs, and using the Manufacturer's Driver Update Utility (Aorus) is not recommended. Most of the Drivers that the program gives you are out of date by more than a few months, free programs such as Driver Booster from iObit work a lot better. The BSODs would give Driver Verifier DMA Violation errors, and no error code, so yet another random shut down that is un-diagnosable.- After performing a fresh install of Windows 10 and all applications. I performed a hard drive health check with HWinfor, and found that the M.2 SSD was already at 74%. Which is very low for a 1 year old laptop. The issues are likely related to the terrible heat managing system for the beefy specs.7) If you do lose a key (which I did), there is not a place that I could find, online or offline, that provides key replacements. The only way you could get a replacement, is to pay for shipping, ship it to the nearest service center for Aorus, and get the entire keyboard replaced.8) Because of the heat requirements, the fans get REALLY loud, you will NEED to use headphones or crank up the speakers all the way. My friend described it as a ""Jet Engine"" when playing with the fans at maximum. High pitched and very loud, you can't game in public like the library, or a coffee shop. ( Make sure to clean the fans regularly, I had the right fan start to go out on me after about 8 months, and it never got back up to it's full speeds after cleaning).The Positives1) It gets the job done, runs the games, and gives 60 FPS comfortably on 1080p resolution ( I almost never found the need to run the laptop on 1620p)2) The keyboard is really nice, feels great, and has great response (Until I lost a key). The individually lit RGB software is easy to use and a nice add-on.3) The profile makes it inconspicuous, and doesn't ""scream"" gamer laptop. With the black metal frame, and only a lit up Aorus logo on the top, it prevents distractions when using it in public.4) Despite the Heating issues, and the temperatures that the laptop reaches, there is a good default fan controlling software (Command and Control) that lets you ramp up the fans as much as they can go, which stabilizes the temperatures at least to the range of 80-90 C.5) The Laptop comes with attachable feet, as if they knew you would need more circulation for this laptop, which haven't failed me in helping the laptop cool itself.6) G-Sync capabilities are nice, you rarely notice screen tears, and you can even change the settings to apply to not only fullscreen mode when gaming.7) The IO is very nice, providing an Ethernet Port, 2 USB 3.0 slots (Thunderbolt 3 Support), 2 USB 2.0 slots, an HDMI slot. an SD card slot, a separate mic and headphone jack, a USB A slot, and a Kensington slot. You won't need an extra USB splitter unless you are using all peripherals.8) The weight for what it contains is very nice, allowing extreme portability for such a powerful machine. Only weighing 5.5 pounds (past 6.0 if you carry the power brick).9) The battery lasts 3-4 hours depending on what you are doing, which is very respectable for a gaming laptop with such powerful specs, if you plan on taking it to more than a few classes, I'd recommend taking the power brick with you.10) The speakers are really nice, they get very loud, and have good sound quality even at the max volumes, you rarely hear peaking or loss in quality unless it's the file itself you are listening to.11) The X-Rite Pantone Calibration, allows for one to flip a switch and get good color accuracy.Overall, the laptop does it's job, plays games with a small figure. However, at a year later, this laptop is not worth it. For what I paid for, I rarely need to overclock the CPU, and since doing that will increase the heat output even further than it already does, I'm sure you'd be putting the laptop on its deathbed. Now with laptops giving 144 Hz refresh rate, 1080p screens, with 8th generation i7 and i5 CPUs, this laptop has been effectively phased out. The negatives of this laptop just make it not worth your money.",true,1,3,"12","B07123ZNTY","laptop gigabyte aorus",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,14,3.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07123ZNTY","43.40",false,false,false,false,"Aorus X5 v7-KL3K3D 15.6"" Notebook IPS WQHD+ 7th Gen Intel i7-7820HK, GeForce GTX 1070 8GB, 16GB DDR4, 256GB SSD Win 10 Sli...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71t57jfTrmL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Both can be upgraded.8. Dedicated audio card.9. 4 speakers. See cons also.Cons.1. Heat. It gets hot on the bottom side.2. Fans can be really noisey when you dont set them up correctly.3. Its only a 60hz screen in $2300.00 laptop.4. Track pad could be better.5. The aorus software it hard to get used to and could be better implimented.6. Battery life sucks.7. Speakers lack substance.I know I have a few cons on here but you cannot have it all. This is a gaming laptop, it will get hot especially with the hardware that is in it. It has plenty or storage and ram and both can be upgraded. Theres an open m.2 slot and two open ram slots. The screen is very nice and can get bright but its a small thing that its only 60hz. Its plenty but for the price it could have been better. The aorus software works fine once you get to know how it operates. I wish there was a better tutorial out there for it. Once you get used to it, the software is fine. I wish they would have used optimus instead of g-sync. I have tried a few other laptops such as the acer predator triton 700 gtx 1060 (I could not get used to the track pad and keyboard location but over all nice. It also had a very clicky keyboard), razer blade 14 gtx 1060( it ran hot all the time and the fans were really loud, like a small jet engine, also limited upgradeability), gigabyte aero 15 ( I know same manufacture but the aero 15 was very nice, small, compact, and great battery life, but it had a few down falls. Coil whine, weak screen hinges, lound ac charger, screen sleep closing angle was way to early like at 45 degrees, plus I had one die on me), 2017 macbook pro 256gb model. (Very nice, great battery life, thin, great speakers, and great screen. The downsides of the macbook pro were no upgrade options. Repair cost were out of sight, and only thunderbolt port options.)The aorus x5 v7 fit the bill of all my needsd of storage and ram capacity, great screen, full size keyboard and backlit, 15 inch, powerful graphics card and cpu.

I've had the X5 v7 about two and a half weeks and these are my impressions of it so far:Pros:OCs very well - 4.3GHz stock and can be pushed more in the BIOS if you want.X-Rite pantone screen color profile looks great.The Command and Control and Driver update Utility are awesome and make monitoring your machine easy.

There was absolutely no dust build up, and minimal use (Mainly got it for downtime at work, only time it is used is 2 or 3 times a week for a couple hours) And for the current price which is now up like nearly $800 more than when I got it, its an ABSOLUTE waste of money. When using the laptop for anything other than gaming its relatively okay. But playing even barely graphically demanding games make the back of the laptop get so hot you cant really touch it comfortable. On top of that, the vents on the bottom have AWFUL airflow since the rubber risers on the bottom practically go all the way around it and trap all the hot air inside. The repairman i brought it also said that it barely even has any kind of heatsink in it because of how tightly crammed in all the components are.IF you plan on buying this, make sure you do everything you can to keep it cooled and increase circulation on the bottom, definitely buy the best cooling pad you can as well",true,1,4,"13","B08D2CR23X","laptop gigabyte aorus",false,2899.95,"USD",0,0,0,90,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08D2CR23X","378.00",false,false,false,false,"[2020] AORUS 15G (XB) Performance Gaming Laptop, 15.6-inch FHD 300Hz IPS, GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q, 10th Gen Intel i7-...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81iJ+xG8JYL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R1ZTB1KP2WTRHK","Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2021",4,"Nice Look - Good Performance For Low Wattage","Note: I bought my laptop for the original $1999 price not the overblown price.First this is a low wattage ""low weight"" laptop for its class. And the GPU is not based off the desktop RTX 3080 but rather a full GA104 chip which I guess comes from the RTX 3070. Not sure though because Nvidia is not clear on this with the laptop chips. It could be a full RTX 3060 chip. Laptop chip specs here if you want to look: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/gaming-laptops/Pros: Strong performing laptop compared to lower end RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 models. Gathering from benchmarks others have done with those models.Other Pros:32GB RAM1TB M.2 SSD (Wish it had 2TB though) -- I did add my own 2TB M.2 SSDIntel 8core/16 Thread CPUNice looking laptopRGB LightingNegatives: Mainly the low wattage which keeps the GPU and CPU from showing their true strengths.Anyway, I really do not have anything to compare this laptop GPU to except my old RTX 2080ti desktop. It doesn't seem to beat it although it is up and down on that front. The low wattage is what keeps this chip down and that is to be expected. But it does have over 6000 CUDA cores so it is beefy in that respect.Do I have buyers remorse? Not really. It does well in gaming at 1080p and 1440p and is not held back by the 8 core Intel chip at all.That being said, I did ramp up as many settings as I could to max out the wattage and power.The laptop comes with the Aorus software to set power to performance and boost the CPU and GPU to max but be wise in your actual needs. The software is a little quirky but after you figure it out it should stay set to where you want it. But don't stop there. Go to the Nvidia control panel in 3D settings and set power management to ""prefer maximum performance"".Also, I have low latency set to Ultra.And resizable bar should be enabled by default although I have no idea if that is helping anything. Especially since Intel chips were not built with that in mind. Where to check: Nvidia control panel then go up top to help then select system info and it should say enabled.I do have an older GTX 1060 laptop with a 6 core Intel chip and it blows that away on all fronts if that helps any.In conclusion for the price I paid I am happy. If you are still worried about that low wattage performance then check out a ""full laptop wattage"" RTX 3070 and that should be fine too.

"R1HLFOA488EIRS","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",4,"Almost Perfect","This is my first Chromebook, and I love almost everything about it.1. The speed is lightening fast2. It is extremely easy to use. I set it up & played around with it for a couple of hours, and learned a ton about the ins & outs of the Chromebook.3. A big 'Yay', on the lack of useless bloatware that is so common on Windows systems.4. The touch screen and mouse pad are both very responsive.5. The screen is crystal clear, and I absolutely LOVE the night time blue light filter. It is so much more pronounced than similar filters on any of my other devices. It really helps with eye strain, and you can use it during the day if you want as well.If I think of any more positives as I use it more, I will add updates.And now, for the one glaring flaw that kept me from giving five stars; The keyboard could be much better, visually. The keys are light, and so are the letters. There is not much contrast at all, so the letters/numbers are really hard to see. Luckily, I've been typing for so long that I can get by. But it'd be much easier if I could see the letters without straining!Since I love everything else about it though, I will happily keep it.

I closed the lid, it kept stuttering audibly. The back was hot. I tried to do a hard shutdown, kept stuttering. I tried to do a hard shutdown for a longer time, stuttering. Finally I just kept the power button in for 2 minutes and it finally stopped. It took several hours to cool down. Later I started it up again, and it worked fine. I used it for some documents, light web viewing. Was fine for several weeks.Today, I used it for a zoom meeting again. After the meeting was over, a notification said restart for new update. I clicked restart, screen went black. It never came back on. It is been several hours, I open the lid and it won't come on.

"RGZNNFWYD31DP","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021",5,"Best chromebook I've used. Perfect for everyday user","The laptop is very well built and doesn't feel cheap. Arguably the best chromebook for the price and features on the market. The keyboard is Back lit and the display is good. The 8gb ram gives it fast response and having 64gb of built in storage is very nice. Gives you plenty of storage for your average user. You can always expand storage with SD card or external hard drive. The battery is very good and touch screen is very responsive. The display is bright and vibrant. With consistent use doing web searching and messing around you will get 8 + hours easy. Charging is fast as well. I did alot of comparison shopping and if you are looking for a laptop for everyday use this is an excellent choice. You can download Microsoft Word and excel free from app store and they work very well. It does take a day or two to get use to the chrome o.s. versus using windows. But, that is expected. It lays flat like a tablet would and automatically turns off keyboard when in the tablet position. The touchscreen is just like using a tablet and response is very good. The camera is decent enough for video calls etc. But probably not as good as newer smart phones offer.I came from a windows o.s background and within a few hours I was use to chrome features and navigation. The apps or ""programs"" are in the task bar which you can be move from bottom left and right side of the screen. At first I was annoyed not being able to move the icons on the home screen as I did with windows machines, but after a while I liked the Taskbar and wasn't bothered at all.To right click you use two fingers at once to click the pad. This threw me off at first. I kept trying to click the right side of the pad with no luck until I looked that up. Just an FYI if you're new to chromebook. But, you get use to that quickly. Overall I'd give it a 9/10. I am fairly tech savvy and needed a laptop for email, web surfing, and other basic needs. This was perfect for me and does everything I need a computer to do fast and efficiently.

"R3BBRLYMC7FCZD","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2021",3,"Underwhelming","Purchasing this laptops is another testament to the fact that good specs don't always amount to a great product. I was deciding between the Gigabyte 17"" and a MacBook Pro 16"" and finally picked the AERO because of it's impressive screen and graphics card. Needles to say I'm experiencing buyers remorse.The Bad:Horrible webcam/nosecam: I don't know why Gigabyte decided to even include this monstrosity. It's completely useless as it gives everyone in your Zoom meeting a detailed look up your nostrils. The cam is mounted in the body so it's not adjustable unless you raise the entire laptop. In the world of remote work a good, usable webcam is a MUST. Dishing out 2500 bucks and realizing that you still need to by an additional webcam to mount on your screen is a joke. GIGABYTE PLEASE FIX.Charging port: It’s located on the right, middle of the laptop which interferes with your mouse, if you have a tight space and are right-handed. Most coffee shops I go to have tiny tables and given the size of this 17.3” laptop there’s very little room.Battery life: I’m a graphic designer that works in 3D occasionally. When I use Photoshop/Illustrator and Dimension I can’t get more than 1 hour of battery life out of this thing even in power saver mode.Screen changes brightness: Yes, it will go darker or lighter without you touching any settings. Not the end of the world, but annoying.Screen goes black: I’ve used this laptop for a month and so far I’ve had at least 5 instances where the screen goes completely black for a second or two. Gigabyte WTF?Annoying keyboard: I’m used to Macs where to change volume you hit F11 or F12. In this thing you have to hold down the Function key in order to adjust volume, so it becomes a two handed operation. I find this really annoying as volume setting is something that is the most adjusted function and needs to be as intuitive as possible.RGB keyboard: This is a Creator’s laptop not a “gamer” laptop. Having the keyboard pulse like a rainbow on acid is not only distracting but also extremely tasteless. If you want to compete with Macbooks please get rid of this gimmick that appeals to 12 year olds.Now the Good:This thing is fast.The screen is beautiful.The GPU kicks ass. It’s 10 times (10!) faster at rendering 3D than my 13” Macbook pro.It’s relatively slim and not too cheesy looking (minus the RGB keyboard) which fortunately you can turn off.About $2500 cheaper than a similarly spec’d out Mac. Mac’s however have better ergonomics.Ports. Useful, but because of its shortcomings I have to use up one USB port for an external cam and another for a mouse. So it’s a mixed bag.Summary:This laptop is good if you keep it plugged in all the time and use it like a desktop. Hauling it around and working on the go is not a real option as you only have about an hour. Gigabyte needs to put more into their product usability testing.",true,1,16,"115","B093Z1PWCF","laptop gigabyte aorus",true,2099,"USD",2499,400,16.01,12,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z1PWCF","44.40",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 17 HDR XD - 17.3"" UHD 4k IPS Anti-Glare, Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, 16GB R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vGsA5sVuS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The 16gb that comes with is probably good enough for the average user.. but I'd recommend atleast upgrading it to 32gb eventually.It is very quite when doing websearching, youtube watching, Autocad or even video/photo editing.When my son used it for minecraft, you can start hearing the fans spin after the laptop starts heating up.... nothing too loud though.(2 Month Update, Final update unless something happens)So after using it for a couple months I realized when using the Laptop on battery once in a while the screen would flash black randomly. This is easily fixed by updating the Intel graphics driver to the newest (As of this review the newest version is: 30.0.100.9805).One more thing for people that have problems with the keyboard settings not staying... update the Gigabyte Control Panel. For me, that fixed it and my keyboard lights up how I selected every startup.Everything else is working great and as expected!I really love this laptop!",true,1,16,"115","B093Z1PWCF","laptop gigabyte aorus",true,2099,"USD",2499,400,16.01,12,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z1PWCF","44.40",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 17 HDR XD - 17.3"" UHD 4k IPS Anti-Glare, Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, 16GB R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vGsA5sVuS._AC_UY218_.jpg""review.id","review.review_data","review.rating","review.title","review.review","review.verified_purchase","product.position.page","product.position.position","product.position.global_position","product.asin","product.keyword","product.price.discounted","product.price.current_price","product.price.currency","product.price.before_price","product.price.savings_amount","product.price.savings_percent","product.reviews.total_reviews","product.reviews.rating","product.url","product.score","product.sponsored","product.amazonChoice","product.bestSeller","product.amazonPrime","product.title","product.thumbnail"

(You can't access the ports on the right if the power cable is facing frontwards.)2) The RGB per-key lighting is beautiful BUT the secondary characters (i.e., when you hit Shift) like for the lighting, sound and even common characters like ( ) @ # $ % on the number row do not light up -- they are not backlit! The problem (via Reddit) is that the Omron switches -- which have excellent tactile feel and travel -- have center lighting only. All right, but the printed secondary characters are done in a wispy light gray which you absolutely cannot see in the dark. (This is a poor design choice here.) They should be near white -- or at least reflect the light of the keys a bit. I just couldn't use this as a developer at night -- you'll need a separate light on to write / program at night. Of course, if you are a good typist, it doesn't matter for the common characters, but for the lighting, sound and other functions you aren't likely to know them by 'muscle memory.')Otherwise, an excellent laptop, but these are two hands-on gotchas you might not notice till you try this out this system in real life.",true,1,4,"13","B07SFR748X","laptop gigabyte g5",true,1599,"USD",1899,300,15.8,212,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFR748X","890.40",false,false,false,false,"Gigabyte AERO 15 OLED Thin and Light Laptop, 15.6 Thin Bezel UHD AMOLED Panel, i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX1660Ti,16GB RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NW5PsqpuL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2ZEGCY5K81U7P","Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2021",5,"Great Laptop","Can’t say enough about this laptop. I’m running the Aero 15 with RTX 2060, i7 9750, and OLED screen.The screen is about as crisp as you can get and the hardware works great together. After I bought the laptop I read a few negative reviews that got me worried. Some of them spoke about the fans being loud. Yes the fans will ramp up while gaming but it’s not a bad thing if you want cool hardware. I’ve heard no “coil whining” and had no issues with the WiFi. If you have issues with this computer it can most likely be fixed by tweaking the firmware and downloading drivers. If you are not at all tech savvy but still want to buy this computer because of the quality the first thing I would do is take it to a friend or someone that can find all the drivers for you and make all the adjustments needed to get this thing working to it’s potential, because once it’s optimized there’s no stopping it. Everything about this laptop screams “Cool”. From the way it runs, to the looks of the screen, the keyboard, and the logo on the back of the screen. The placement of the camera isn’t an issue if you don’t care about the views from your webcam, which I don’t. As far as gaming goes, I’ve run COD Black Ops Cold War (Multiplayer and Main Story) and No Mans Sky, both of which have worked great. May have to lower the video settings in the game itself to get the FPS up but it’s possible to run games at 70 FPS.

Division 2 averaged over 120 fps at max settings at 1080p. I tested war thunder, escape from tarkov andmordhau as well and both were extremely smooth (both hit 144hz reliably at ultra 1080p). No noticable input or screen lag in mordhau so fast shooterswill benefit as well.• No noticeable micro stutters when switching from• The laptop top doesn’t feel hot under pressure but I wouldn’t play this on my lap.• I added a 1tb WD Blue NVMe stick to this laptop, its easy to do and there are videos of how to do it.• The GPU runs cool for a laptop (avg 78 under pressure) but the CPU doesn’t. You can fix this by limiting the max power in power settings for the CPU or undervolting it. The cpu has initial spikes in temp but usually ends up in the mid 80s which is a little hot but expected.• Use dragon center to tune the performance. Don’t run extreme performance without cooler boost.• Buy a cooling pad and watch temps for the CPU, the CPU is the only thing that holds this beast back because it tends to hit high temps (95c max from what I saw) if left at max settings.• It has 2x USB3.2and 2x USB-C so you might need to buy an usb dongle. It has a single jack for a headset so you might need to buy a splitter depending on your headset.• One HDMI only. No displayport at all which is something to consider.

"RTB9AWLRB7F9C","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",3,"Almost","I really had high hopes for this laptop but I found a couple of issues that caused me to return it. First, there was a little bit of backlight bleed on the bottom left side of the screen. While the screen was nice and there was the normal amount of IPS glow, the little white light bleeding through on the bottom left caused me some concern. Although it was not much, it was enough for me to wonder if it would get worse over time. Knowing that there have been some who have complained about screen issues, I did not want to take the chance.Second, the laptop had a few keys that had tactile issues. The #3, #4, and W were not as responsive and springy as the other keys. When I barely moved my fingers across the number row without applying pressure, I could feel that the #3 and #4 keys seemed to be off a little. It worked when typing but I could tell the difference between them and the other keys. The W key was not as bad but you could still feel the difference between it and the Q, E, A, and S. While they may have never caused any issues throughout the life of the laptop, I don't want to take that risk with a $1000+ laptop. I have seen videos and forum posts about this same model where keys are sticking and/or not responding. I did not want to send it to Lenovo for warranty service since I just bought it. Personally, I don't trust a device that has to receive warranty repairs right out of the box.

"RLL7YBBO1REME","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",2,"Too light, cheap plastic, flimsy","I gave it two stars because specs and performance are both acceptable but that’s where the good ends for me. It’s wordy but here’s the scoop: This 16” 2021 Gram is the cheapest, “plasticky” feeling laptop I’ve ever held. The specs are good, performance is good but there is zero chance of this thing lasting through anything (regardless of that phony“military tested” hogwash they claim) and to make matters even worse, there is, likely a near ZERO chance of LG standing behind it because LG is as bad as it gets when it comes to support (based on 1st hand experience). It is probably called the Gram because it weighs close enough to a gram that they can legally name it that. It feels like a $149 Chromebook. Seriously, it does! If anyone says otherwise, they aren’t being too honest. It may actually BE better than a cheap Chromebook but it surely does NOT feel like it. It feels too light, too flimsy and too cheap, IMO. This is my 2nd Gram and on the first one, the screen strangely snapped like a thin dry twig (think toothpick) and a few years later I thought I’d try LG again and this feels even MORE like a product from Toys R Us than the first one I purchased from LG a couple years back. I sent this new, even flimsier version back like I should have done with the first one and proceeded to pay the extra few bucks for a beautiful, well built, solid aluminum and perfectly weighted Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 and this gem is a keeper! Complete different league of products….period! And not too much more $$ either! What the hell was I thinking? Screw me once, shame on you….etc……Summary: If you are a fan of ridiculously light electronics or you are a fan of well assembled Fisher Price toys, the LG Gram might be a perfect choice. If a solid, premium feeling device is desirable then my recommendation is a definite pass on LG’s Gram! It just feels wrong and over priced! Especially after holding and using a Surface Laptop 4 (which also has a touch screen). The Surface Laptop 4 works, looks AND feels 100% premium and frankly, aside from decent looks and of course performance, how a laptop “feels” is important to me. That is the straight forward scoop folks….from a 30 year computer (IT) professional. P.S. So I don’t seem like a MS fanboy, there ARE other premium feeling laptops, ASUS Zenbook, HP Spectre, some Dell models and a limited few others like MacBooks but MAC OS sucks BUT their hardware is quite premium and, really sets the bar for hardware but MS hit it out of the park here!I’m just comparing with the Surface Laptop 4 because I have one and can fairly compare it with the hapless Gram.",true,1,8,"17","B08SW2RC6V","laptop gigabyte g5",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,76,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SW2RC6V","326.80",false,false,false,false,"LG LCD Laptop 16"" WGXGA (2560x1600) Ultra-Lightweight (2.6 lbs), 11th gen CORE i7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, C Port, USB-A, HDM...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pKId7SSYS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and added a 1 TB internal SSD and the review is based on the computer after the upgrades.Pros:-The visual fidelity is outstanding. Games like Battlefield 4 and 5 run perfectly and look amazing. Forza -Horizon 4 runs amazing at high FPS around 80 to 90 on high settings.-The Windows home screen and Cortana work great since it has a built in mic and designated buttons on the keyboard. Much better usage than on a PC.-It is very lightweight and portable.-Screen has soft colors but is very crisp.-Boot times are very fast.Cons-The battery life is atrocious but who isn't gaming without plugging in first? Watching Youtube only the battery lasted unplugged around 3 hours.-The laptop gets pretty warm and the fans are loud almost instantly loading into a game. This is not a huge issue for anyone wearing headphones.-The layout of the keyboard is very tight and you will click the wrong keys at some point. Also the touchpad is in a very strange position offset to the left so you'll want to disable it and use a mouse.Overall, this is a fantastic laptop for anyone getting into gaming computing. I own a PC with a 2080ti and even still am impressed by this little computer. The budgeting option to spend $168 a month for 5 months was a no brainer to me.

It's solidly constructed, with a comfortable keyboard, good screen, feels fast despite not being high-spec. But increasingly in the last few weeks, it's had trouble holding a wi-fi connection, even when just a few feet away from the router. Doesn't matter whether it's at home or elsewhere, the same issue happens: at least a couple times an hour, it'll stop seeing the router and become completely disconnected. It takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes to see the router again and reconnect. It's not a heat issue -- this thing never gets hot -- and it's not a line of sight problem or anything like that. Moving it to another place doesn't help it see the connection again.Pretty disappointing.

"R1BS946CW9MYT7","Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2021",4,"Almost excellent laptop.","Been playing around with the 16 inch version for several weeks now. build-wise I am very pleased. The screen doesn't wobble too much and the keyboard is just lovely to use. I will say there's one potential issue, where if you put enough weight/pressure on the space left or right of the touch pad, you can get it to register as a click, but in practical use it never happened. Something to watch out for if you have massive sausage arms that lay flat on the laptop, maybe. That aside, I REALLY like the trackpad. It's been like a decade since I used a laptop pad so I was assuming a mouse would be a mandatory purchase, but not anymore. The multi-touch controls work great, and it's nice and big so I never feel like my fingers are gravitating too far into a corner to browse properly.On the software side of things I am impressed with the SSD and operating system. Once you got your user settings entered the first time around, the computer can go from the powered-off state to your home screen in like fifteen seconds. I haven't extensively tested the CPU, though I've found it can run Overwatch at low settings and 60fps with only minimal tinkering.I primarily use it for writing and the occasional google research/time waster, which it handles with ease, and I'm sure it could stream a Spotify setlise or play iTunes on top of that as well. It also didn't seem like a big deal at first, but the fingerprint scanner is so nifty to have, I have actually become spoiled on it and feel irritated when I have to type my password out on the desktop.There are some ""bloatware"" applications pre-installed that you could do without, such as McCaffee, but mostly the applications seem fine. There's the LG Virtoo app that can sync to an LG phone, which I also happen to have. Testing it...I mean, it works, you can send/receive calls through the laptop and copy over any photos you've taken, but the bluetooth connectivity would kill your phone battery with any extensive use, and the sound/mic quality on the Gram is not professional by any means. Far more useful is the simple control panel that has your power features, screen brightness and fan options at just a click away. There's also an LG-branded video editor, though given the Gram's low voltage and integrated graphics, I doubt you'd want to compile any 4k footage on this laptop.There's only a handful of nitpicks bring it down to a 4/5. Main thing is, for whatever reason, I can't get it to save separate power usage/brightness settings depending on whether it's plugged in or not. This is quickly fixed by clicking the battery on the taskbar and using the hotkeys to change the screen's brightness, but it is irksome to do it EVERY single time. Secondly, if you use the Gram at a less than full charge while charging, the charger brick gets surprisingly warm. I'd say it's hot, even. Lastly, the screen is really glossy. As a cave-dwelling hermit this doesn't affect me, but I can imagine using this in an outdoor setting or coffee shop with a bunch of overhead lamps might not be the best experience.Can I recommend this absurdly expensive laptop to everyone? Well, no. It fits my niche of needing a super lightweight quiet writing device with a decent screen size, easily capable of some research googles or wasting time with very light gaming sessions. In this regard I am super satisfied. If you need something for gaming, media production or media consumption, there are cheaper, better options available.",true,1,16,"115","B08SW6BFWV","laptop gigabyte g5",true,1429.99,"USD",1699.99,270,15.88,68,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SW6BFWV","312.80",false,false,false,false,"LG LCD Laptop 16"" WQXGA (2560 x 1600) IPS LCD Display , DCI-P3 99%, 11th gen Intel core i7, Intel Xe Graphics, 16GB RAM, 1...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y9aJKvvlS._AC_UY218_.jpg""review.id","review.review_data","review.rating","review.title","review.review","review.verified_purchase","product.position.page","product.position.position","product.position.global_position","product.asin","product.keyword","product.price.discounted","product.price.current_price","product.price.currency","product.price.before_price","product.price.savings_amount","product.price.savings_percent","product.reviews.total_reviews","product.reviews.rating","product.url","product.score","product.sponsored","product.amazonChoice","product.bestSeller","product.amazonPrime","product.title","product.thumbnail"

I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times. Clickers work well andthe wheel was surprisingly better than I feared - not exactly smoot, not horribly bumpy.Overall, I like this mouse and for the money, feel like I got a good product for the cost.

"RT1J0SNBACNSC","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"Completely useless for my target purpose (gaming)","I've had a SteelSeries Rival 310 for a couple of years now and am perfectly happy with it, but then I found out about this model which seemed like a straight upgrade to me after watching and reading a couple of reviews. After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors.

Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced.

I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times. Clickers work well andthe wheel was surprisingly better than I feared - not exactly smoot, not horribly bumpy.Overall, I like this mouse and for the money, feel like I got a good product for the cost.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,5,"14","B08176SM7C","steelseries aerox",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split Trigger Buttons...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you?

I'm not sure why gaming mouses don't have right side buttons. So basically I got this mouse for the buttons.I play 3 different action MMORPGs with action combat, using mouse clicks for skills.The left side buttons are so faulty and trash. There's friction between my finger and the mouse skills popping off when I click.This mouse was not designed for gaming... The left side buttons are too far forward and flimsy. It does not feel like I'm pressing a button, more like reaching for something unsecured and difficult to push.The clickers need to pressed rather than lightly touched. I find this to be harder to deal with ... Think about slamming your hand flat on a table, this is what it feels like to press the clickers.Something more annoying than the buttons is the failure to load. Sharkoon always loads, crosair does not.I have had to restart computer, unplug and replug, even loaded the ique software. Why? Because the mouse DOES NOT COME ON.. A few times it shut off completely.

"R984ASFJKOIKG","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2021",3,"Great...When it works....","Pros:- Great overall sound when using the speakers- Comfortable and adjusts nicely- Solid construction- Retractable Mic boom is nice and works- BluetoothCons:- Will randomly shut off without warning, or cut out before just turning off (tried with 2 different pairs)- Can only use EITHER the Speakers or Headset but not both- Constantly have to toggle which audio is being used by which device at which time- No batter indicator- Steelseries software is mostly just bloat and offers zero actual functionalityTL;DR; Speakers are great, ""headset audio"" is garbage (unless doing video/voice calls for work)If you are getting these to connect with your Macbook for work calls, great. The Bluetooth seems to work well with Macs. If you are planning on gaming with them then go pick up a cheaper pair of something because you cannot have nice audio (speakers) & voice-chat (headset) at the same time due to the way the codecs are setup for Bluetooth. Also Windows Bluetooth (tried multiple adapters and built-in BT) will randomly drop the connection. I just wanted a nice headset that just worked, and what I got was a nice headset that sometimes turns itself off, and having to choose between chatting with friends OR hearing my game. Works with Xbox (as it advertises) but I assume like with everything else it is using the headset so you can chat and hear audio which makes the audio garbage.",true,1,5,"15","B07RJHH6Q8","steelseries arctis",false,193.99,"USD",0,0,0,13786,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RJHH6Q8","59279.80",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Arctis 9X Wireless Gaming Headset – Integrated Xbox Wireless + Bluetooth – 20+ Hour Battery Life – for Xbox On...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81t7C7EiagL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R7OWJHZ5SMBBB","Reviewed in Spain on September 23, 2021",,"BONITO DISEÑO. BUEN SONIDO","The media could not be loaded. 7️⃣ VALORACIÓNEn muchos de las reviews que hay de auriculares, estos modelos son los que más valoraciones positivas consiguen. Hablamos de una gama media de auriculares por menos de 100€Todos estos modelos cuenta con un bonito diseño y buena calidad de sonido, por lo que la diferencia entre ellosse base en pequeños matices o accesorios incluidos.En el caso de estos auriculares SteelSeries Arctis 3, estamos ante unos auriculares con etiqueta gaming, pero con un diseño elegante y de calidad.Lo que más destacaría de este modelo es su comodidad junto a con su calidad de sonido, aunque bajo mi punto de vista, está un poco por debajo que el Logitech G PRO o el HyperX Cloud Alpha Pro. La diferencia eneste modelo, es que NO viene con la tarjeta de sonido USB incluida.En cuanto a su comodidad, la diadema es de plástico duro y tiene una goma que es la que se adapta a tu cabeza. Esta goma es ajustable. Las orejeras, con de espuma, muy cómodas lo que los hace unos auriculares realmente agradables.Cualquiera de los otros modelos de auriculares presentan una gran comodidad, si bien, el Logitech G PRO y el modelo de HyperX Cloud Alpha Pro puede que tenga una presión en los laterales, un poco más acentuada. Para mi no es algo muy significativo ya que no noto gran diferencia, pero puede que alguien que por ejemplo use gafas, puede fijarse más en estos detalles.Yo buscaba unos auriculares que tuviesen el micro y el cable de audio extraíble y que pudiese encontrar fácilmente repuestos. Estos auriculares cuentan con dos conexiones jack 3.5mm en un auricular, sin embargo, el micrófono NO es extraible, sino que es retráctil, se oculta dentro de al auricular izquierdo.Tiene un control de volumen lo tienes en el propio auricular, a diferencia de otros modelos, que tienen el control en el propio cable.✅ CONCLUSIÓNUnos auriculares con un relación calidad/precio justa. Unos auriculares gaming a buen precio.

Its wireless.Ok the negatives. To maximise the headphones capabilities you need to manipulate how loud certain frequencies are at otherwise the sound will just not be as optimal. Songs will have less impact, audio from movies, TV shows feels flat. Then we have the actual application the Steel Series engine 3. My god what a mess... Anytime a headset needs an additional program feels like an incomplete product. I get it if people who are more well versed in headphones will enjoy tinkering with the details but the system just didn't work. So much trial and error just to get feedback on the microphone because the ""noise cancelling"" part of the headphones literally makes me feel like my head is being crushed.""DTS Headphone:X v2.0 Surround for PC"" Yea ok buddy, I tested surround sound with a headset that did have surround sound and tried it on a YouTube video that had capabilities for surround. Did not work for Arctis 7. Everything at the same volume no panning to either side. If you're buying this as a ""gaming headset"" look elsewhere.Look there are almost 0 reason to actually go for wireless headset besides the fact that it has no wires. Sure you could go to your bathroom while having it on but that really is it. Nice battery life I still have to charge the damn thing. Basically you still have a cord but you can occasinally take it off and still hear you sick beats woohoo.TL:DR: Its a very average wireless headset, there's no surround sound so don't bother with fps games with this headset, you are basically putting yourself at an disadvantage.

I'd argue the G935 is more comfortable, but when buying this, what I was looking for was better surround sound which it delivers to an extent.I don't have a big head, but I believe having it a bit bigger will help cover more sound and have a better immersive surround sound.The connectivity range is really far, much farther than the G935.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The con that this headset does have is that it is not loud enough compared to the G935.I find it funny that this was listed by many as the top wireless headset.The mic quality is okay, but if you were to look up, you would have to tweak it a bit because there are times when your microphone has an echo.It's really tough to find a list of top high end wireless headsets with surround sound without pricing impacting the list.For the price, I would say that this is not worth it.

"R3FC9M96NF0FDD","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021",5,"Working well","Mice are like shoes, so it's difficult to say what works well for everyone. I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times. Clickers work well andthe wheel was surprisingly better than I feared - not exactly smoot, not horribly bumpy.Overall, I like this mouse and for the money, feel like I got a good product for the cost. I generally go through mice every 1 to 3 years, depending on how they hold up. I'm hoping this holds up to the task.",true,1,12,"113","B09BRFNP6F","steelseries arctis",false,129.99,"USD",0,0,0,442,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BRFNP6F","1944.80",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries Prime Mini Wireless FPS Gaming Mouse – 100 Hour Battery – USB-C – 18,000 CPI TrueMove Air Optic...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/516icJUCdEL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2NZR693TI2X91","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2021",4,"THIS HEADSET IS AIMBOT. I'd buy again. One year later.","These are not Bluetooth. They are USB dongle wireless. The dongle is usb-c so it can be used with smartphones. I have it connected to a normal USB adapter to connect to my system. I used it for months with PS4 before purchasing a PS5. Works fine on both systems. It comes with a wired cord so there's an input for wired connectivity as well.On a full charge I'm able to game all day. I'd say around 12 hours at least. I like that it has a beeping indicator that let's you know when the battery is low. I've got through an entire 30 min warzone match before it died post notification. Exceptional battery life.This headset can be louder than it needs to be. I hear footsteps that my friends don't. I think they use cheap turtle beach or dollar store headsets. Whenever I'm spectating them in warzone I call out guys they SWEAR they don't hear. THIS HEADSET IS AIMBOT.I've recorded my games and listened to myself and the mic is super exceptional. Teammates have no issues hearing me. And at least while running it wirelessly, teammates don't hear their voice feedback while communicating. I think it has that feedback issue while running wired. Haven't tested that on PS5. I wouldn't run wired while gaming with friends but if you're playing solo it should be fine.My only gripe about this headset is the build quality. The headrest cushion is slightly detaching so it snags my ""pretty black boy blonde hair"" when I remove the headset as seen in pictures I provided. Praying it doesn't leave me bald overtime. This happened 2-3 months in of owning the headset. Possibly sooner. It's not an absolute deal breaker for me. I should probably super glue it back. However because of that, I'll be giving it 4 of 5 stars.If you want AIMBOT, if you want a wireless headset, if you want to hear all the footsteps in COD this headset is for you. If you don't want your hair snagged when removing... Don't get this headset. But that issue could possibly be fixed with super glue. I've used this headset for a full year.

They are just fine for the Switch. Not too much intrusion, but I did end up using a set of analog plug headphones there because my M-Pows are simply better sounding without tuning them.

You want it for work and gaming without spending a stupid amount of money. Enter the Steelseries Prime FPS gaming mouse....not too fancy, built well and is a real delight to use.

"R3FC9M96NF0FDD","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021",5,"Working well","Mice are like shoes, so it's difficult to say what works well for everyone. I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times. Clickers work well andthe wheel was surprisingly better than I feared - not exactly smoot, not horribly bumpy.Overall, I like this mouse and for the money, feel like I got a good product for the cost. I generally go through mice every 1 to 3 years, depending on how they hold up. I'm hoping this holds up to the task.",true,1,1,"10","B093LV8SPK","steelseries prime",false,79.52,"USD",0,0,0,442,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093LV8SPK","1944.80",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries Prime+ FPS Gaming Mouse – 18,000 CPI TrueMove Pro+ Optical Sensor – 5 Programmable Buttons – Ma...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61iCliK8ViS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times. Clickers work well andthe wheel was surprisingly better than I feared - not exactly smoot, not horribly bumpy.Overall, I like this mouse and for the money, feel like I got a good product for the cost.

"RT1J0SNBACNSC","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"Completely useless for my target purpose (gaming)","I've had a SteelSeries Rival 310 for a couple of years now and am perfectly happy with it, but then I found out about this model which seemed like a straight upgrade to me after watching and reading a couple of reviews. After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,10,"19","B08176SM7C","steelseries prime",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split Trigger Buttons...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

These pudding style keys allow the RGB lighting to come through much brighter than the stock ones and make the lighting effects more impactful, especially those effects which utilize many colors.The main reason I went with the SteelSeries caps as opposed to other pudding-style caps is the inclusion of multiple sets of bottom row keys in this set. Some keyboards (like my Corsair unit) come with different sized bottom row keys, which are not compatible with all sets of keycaps. While this set of keycaps may cost a bit more than other sets out there, the inclusion of multiple sets of bottom keys gives some peace of mind that this set will fit your particular keyboard.Additionally, I like the feel of these keycaps better than the stock ones that ship with the Corsair K70 and I don't think that these get marked up as much from general use.Overall, these SteelSeries Pudding Keycaps are a welcome upgrade to my set up and the added assurance that this set gives by including multiple sizes of bottom row shouldn't be dismissed.",true,1,11,"110","B0954THS76","steelseries prime",false,29.99,"USD",0,0,0,106,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0954THS76","498.20",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries PRISMCAPS - Double Shot Pudding-Style Keycaps - Durable PBT Thermoplastic - Compatible with a W...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71whQaGDLeS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Songs will have less impact, audio from movies, TV shows feels flat. Then we have the actual application the Steel Series engine 3. My god what a mess... Anytime a headset needs an additional program feels like an incomplete product.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,16,"115","B093LSMKL3","steelseries prime",true,49.99,"USD",59.99,10,16.67,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093LSMKL3","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries Rival 5 Gaming Mouse with PrismSync RGB Lighting and 9 Programmable Buttons – FPS, MOBA, MMO, B...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QdKZP26rS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you?

I use the Xbox elite controller, and have never had this issue until using this headset.I think it has something to do with the proprietary adapter that they use.Without the adapter, the controller never has the issue and the headset works fine..Recently, I was using my headset and it suddenly stopped working with the Xbox chat.I checked the cords, reset the receiver and did several other resets to it as well.Finally after setting the receiver back to factory defaults, I was able to get it working again.The product support on their website is very slow as well.They only email you, and it takes about 24 hours to hear back from them for each reply.That being said, they did offer to send me a new cord for my headset.. though I'd imagine that was not the cause of my issue..Overall, I've probably dumped at least 200-300 hours into this headset, the multiple batteries are very nice and the sound is great.Aside from the occasional bugs, it's not a bad headset.",true,1,19,"118","B00Z6OKIAC","steelseries prime",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,146,3.8,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Z6OKIAC","554.80",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Siberia X800 Wireless Gaming Headset with Dolby 7.1 Surround Sound for Xbox One, Xbox 360","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9144KkSa62L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"RT1J0SNBACNSC","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"Completely useless for my target purpose (gaming)","I've had a SteelSeries Rival 310 for a couple of years now and am perfectly happy with it, but then I found out about this model which seemed like a straight upgrade to me after watching and reading a couple of reviews. After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,1,"10","B08176SM7C","steelseries rival",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times.

"RT1J0SNBACNSC","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"Completely useless for my target purpose (gaming)","I've had a SteelSeries Rival 310 for a couple of years now and am perfectly happy with it, but then I found out about this model which seemed like a straight upgrade to me after watching and reading a couple of reviews. After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,4,"13","B08176SM7C","steelseries rival",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

These pudding style keys allow the RGB lighting to come through much brighter than the stock ones and make the lighting effects more impactful, especially those effects which utilize many colors.The main reason I went with the SteelSeries caps as opposed to other pudding-style caps is the inclusion of multiple sets of bottom row keys in this set. Some keyboards (like my Corsair unit) come with different sized bottom row keys, which are not compatible with all sets of keycaps. While this set of keycaps may cost a bit more than other sets out there, the inclusion of multiple sets of bottom keys gives some peace of mind that this set will fit your particular keyboard.Additionally, I like the feel of these keycaps better than the stock ones that ship with the Corsair K70 and I don't think that these get marked up as much from general use.Overall, these SteelSeries Pudding Keycaps are a welcome upgrade to my set up and the added assurance that this set gives by including multiple sizes of bottom row shouldn't be dismissed.",true,1,7,"16","B0954THS76","steelseries rival",false,29.99,"USD",0,0,0,106,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0954THS76","498.20",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries PRISMCAPS - Double Shot Pudding-Style Keycaps - Durable PBT Thermoplastic - Compatible with a W...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71whQaGDLeS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I don't know if Steelseries made those keycaps taller on purpose, or it could be some quality control issues.The factory Apex 7 TKL's keycapshave a really smooth surface without a grainy feeling, and I like it. So I assume they would make the same texture with their PBT pudding keycaps.

They were a little more expensive than the Hyper X pudding caps, but the font is better and there are included keys for standard and non-standard bottom rows. The feel is really nice, the home (F and J) keys have the raised bits, and the illumination factor is UNREAL. A picture can't really do justice to the diffusing factor in the white, bottom part of the keys - and yes, these keys still get plenty bright. The finish on the tops have a nice, slightly textured surface so your fingers don't slide. Nitpicking, if you look really closely, you can see a few dim spots in the traces (like the 8's and 0's), and the finish on the outside of the keys isn't perfect. For instance, on the space bar key there are some very small raised bumps on the top anterior of the black portion. These could probably be sanded off, and are most likely a product of how the black and white parts of the keys are molded. Overall, really nice, would buy again.

I'm a big guy with a wide hand and I like how this mouse just fits perfectly when i use it. I previously used another gaming mouse but never really paid attention to its size until i felt some unease whenever i would use it, and so that's when i decided to look for a much bigger mouse.. I'll say one thing about this item that I would like to address to those who are seeking for a large size mouse, this is the item you probably would like to get. I mean this mouse is longer, a bit more wider and the depth i would say is just fitting for its built. My hand is able to cover the whole mouse giving me a much, much better grasp and hold when use it. Compared to my previous mouse, my fingers would have to sorta adjust to its size and it's just uncomfortable and strains my hand muscles..So, if you're looking for a big mouse to give you a better feel, this is the mouse to go for. Also, as I didn't mention anything about its mechanics and functions, that's because I have no problem with it whatsoever. Everything works as its suppose to.

I had this headset for 3+ years and just recently ordered another one (the old one isn’t broken it’s just kinda gross from so much use - around 3+ hours a day)This headset has amazing sound localization, the frame and cord are both super durable, and comfort is superb from my experience. They don’t stay quite as cool around the ears as the Hyper X Cloud II, but I can wear them for hours without any heat discomfort. The way the frame works/adjusts around the head let’s it fit snuggly without putting too much pressure which is great for comfort. That also means that it doesn’t give as bad of headphone hairdo (though it still leaves a minor impression on the hair). If you are on PlayStation or PC you can connect it to your system through the USB which adds the nice option of being able to mute your mic and adjust the volume of yourself and of your game. When I play on Xbox I just connect the headphone jack directly to my controller through a headset adapter (which is no longer in production from Microsoft, but it is great and gives the option to mute)As far as mic quality, it’s pretty great, voice goes through nice and crisp and the noise gate on the mic is really effective at preventing unwanted sounds (AC, breathing, etc.) from being picked up.One of the best headsets I’ve ever had.",true,1,6,"16","B08NSVZHXK","steelseries tusq",true,89.99,"USD",149.99,60,40,232,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NSVZHXK","1044.00",false,false,false,false,"HyperX Cloud Revolver - Gaming Headset with HyperX 7.1 Surround Sound, Signature Memory Foam, Premium Leatherette, Steel F...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ah0Nj7McL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The Bluetooth seems to work well with Macs. If you are planning on gaming with them then go pick up a cheaper pair of something because you cannot have nice audio (speakers) & voice-chat (headset) at the same time due to the way the codecs are setup for Bluetooth. Also Windows Bluetooth (tried multiple adapters and built-in BT) will randomly drop the connection.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,13,"113","B08176SM7C","steelseries tusq",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split Trigger Buttons...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

They don’t stay quite as cool around the ears as the Hyper X Cloud II, but I can wear them for hours without any heat discomfort. The way the frame works/adjusts around the head let’s it fit snuggly without putting too much pressure which is great for comfort. That also means that it doesn’t give as bad of headphone hairdo (though it still leaves a minor impression on the hair).

Software is intuitive for the most part and easy to setup. Software can be buggy sometimes when trying to launch the application but a simple fix for me was to end the services related to the app and re launch. Discord integration is a nice feature but could be improved upon with more option for specific notifications and a setting for longer display of said notifications. Also display is to narrow and at an angle for you to read. Notifications don’t seem to fully display only the beginning part of a message. The weight of the mouse is a turn off. I purchased this with the intent of capitalizing on the features but I was hugely disappointed. Tactical feedback is weak on highest setting making the build feel cheap especially considering the weight of this mouse. The on board memory is somewhat bugged. For example if I set button 4 to mouse button 1 and toggle repeat my clicks won’t register on button 1 or button 4 so I have to open the software reconfigure the settings. It might work for sometime but then the issue happens again and when I start the software it shows some my bindings have changed even though I have all of my profiles duplicated on board. So on board memory and software integration is a inconsistent at best. For example toggle hold works fine for me but repeat on hold does nothing.

Forced me to change mice in search of a better ergonomic shape. -1star for this.Other -1 star is because the screen on the mouse is very limited in its functionality. I was hoping to be able to set it up for whatever game I wanted and even do a little programming to make cool functionality with it, but its completely inaccessible, and can only accept gif images at low framerates. The coolest thing I made it do was display a shape that changed at the corners.

Long story short, it is compatible but will not have volume control, a mute option, or the 7.1 surround sound option. These are made for PC.Gave it 5 stars because it looks really nice, is super comfortable, and would probably be a phenomenal headset for a PC (I don't have a gaming PC) however, due to the USB connection off the headset, it isn't compatible with an Xbox controller.The wire coming off the ear cup ends with a 3.5 mm aux cord designed for an Xbox controller. You then plug that aux output into the headsets in-line controller, and that controller then ends with a USB plug. That in-line controller controls the 7.1 surround sound, volume, and mute controls. So in theory, yes, you can plug this in to an Xbox controller via the 3.5 aux tip and use the headset. However, you will not have any volume controls, mute option, or 7.1 surround sound. Xbox doesn't even support 7.1 surround sound by the way.Save yourself some money, and buy a wired headset with in line controls that is designed for Xbox.
