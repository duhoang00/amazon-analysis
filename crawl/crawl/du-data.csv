The keyboard feels heavy and solid, so I had confidence in it working well and being reliable. However, lately the space bar has been acting up. It 'duds' sometimes causing the space bar to not travel straight down, especially when hitting it off center towards the right side.This is very annoying as space bar strokes are almost by definition (two hand typing) off-center. This is definitely something with the underlying mechanics in the keyboard or the stabilizing mounts.This has become a real nuisance, I am with some regularity missing entire space bar strokes, which is sadness, I liked this keyboard otherwise, but I am afraid I will have to junk it, missing 1 out of N key strokes is simply unacceptable.POST EDIT: I contacted the seller who advised to remove the space bar and clean the stabilizers, which didn't really help much, but now I have a 2nd problem that the Caps Lock and ESC keys sometimes output garbage which could either be indicators of dirt or short on the circuit, or a break in the circuit?It looks impossible to clean this keyboard internally without desoldering the whole thing, remvoing the external housing doesn't do much other than concluding that the board and is inaccessible, so if there were an issue that can be fixed, there is no way to get there",true,1,1,"10","B0875TLV55","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,280,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0875TLV55","1260.00",false,false,false,false,"iKBC CD108 V2 Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Clear Switch for Windows and Mac, Full Size Keyboard Upgraded w...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NUI1h95ML._AC_UY218_.jpg"

This interference occurs enough that I would say even for typing/document work it's annoying enough to recommend avoiding.",true,1,15,"114","B084GMXD3S","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,96.99,"USD",0,0,0,58,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084GMXD3S","237.80",false,false,false,false,"iKBC W200 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Brown Switch for Windows and Mac OS, Enables Media Key and LED Indic...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TLUqMDYzL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I did not know mechanical keyboards were a thing until this past month. I've been geeking out on them since, and have tried several, with wireless being my essential requirement.As keyboard geeks know, this limits the selection. I sampled several different brands (with Brown, Red, and Topre switches) but was not too impressed and sent each of them back. Some used Bluetooth and establishing connections was not always easy. The dongle/2.4 setup is best for wireless.These Cherry Blues are heavenly and this iKBC keyboard is the One. The wireless works perfectly with no perceptible lag when I'm typing at 100 wpm.

"R1EWIX4Y6FOEQW","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2021",5,"Small keycaps?Odd complaint","1.) ""Small"" keycaps.I was reading through the Amazon reviews on this keyboard and I was somewhat alarmed by the one that complained about the size of the keycaps.These keys are a very normal size.They width of the top of the key is .515"" according to my calipers (13mm).2.) With or without number pad?So I use this keyboard with either a mouse or a touchpad sitting just to the right of the keyboard.Since I use the mouse/touchpad so frequently, I find that the reduced distance I need to travel in order to get to the keyboard/mouse is wonderful, so I recommend omitting the number pad.I have a second keyboard that has a number pad that I can pull out if I have a bunch of number data entry to do, but for daily typing tasks, I don't feel like I'm missing much by not having the number pad.3.) Feeling of the key action (aka the switches).I got the Cherry MX brown switches.They seem great, but I'm not a mechanical switch aficionado.I would love to have tried them all out side by side, but I'm happy with the browns.They aren't too loud, but they're definitely not silent.My laptop keyboard and my other keyboard (Microsoft wireless bluetooth keyboard) are both virtually silent.4.) Typing speed.I type pretty quickly, and although I feel like I'm still getting used to this bad boy, I find that the responsiveness is very good, and I did a quick typing test online to see the how I was doing on the new keys.The Microsoft keyboard requires quite a bit of force to depress each key.The Cherry browns are definitely a much lighter actuation force.I found that I was immediately able to type about 15-20% faster which I attribute mostly to the lighter key actuation force and the solidity of the keyboard.5.) Build quality.Last thing I'll mention is that this keyboard is heavy.It feels well built and I suspect that it will last me for a long long time.Maybe (hopefully) a lifetime.6.) Scratchiness on the keystroke.There was a complaint from another reviewer that the keys felt a little scratchy on the way down as they are being depressed (They compared the feeling to another mechanical keyboard that they had used which felt ""silky smooth"").I notice this as well.I'm not sure if it bothers me, but I agree that it is noticeable.All that said, I have only had the keyboard for a day, so take it with a grain of salt.We'll see what I think in a year about this guy.",true,1,15,"114","B084GMXD3S","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,96.99,"USD",0,0,0,58,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084GMXD3S","237.80",false,false,false,false,"iKBC W200 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Brown Switch for Windows and Mac OS, Enables Media Key and LED Indic...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TLUqMDYzL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R8YQ1G7VUH60Q","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021",5,"Phenomenal! ...But Takes Some Getting Used To","Okay so I absolutely love this keyboard, no doubt about that now. It wasn't like that at first though.I initially purchased the keyboard for my first gaming desktop PC (avid longtime PC gamer, putting in 80-90 hours every week on average back on my gaming laptops) and I liked the black/white aesthetic that matched my PC and speakers, but also because of its minimalist design and THE VOLUME KNOB <3Upon first getting it and using it however, I found myself accidentally pressing other keys by accident because they aren't spaced very far apart and don't take a lot of force to press. Honestly I almost considered returning it after a few days because I hated all the misspellings I was making and having to correct.After a few weeks of usage though I suddenly realised that I wasn't making misspellings hardly at all anymore and my fingers had already memorised the placement of all the keys so I don't even look at the keyboard when I type now.So for anyone who just got this keyboard and is having a similar issue, just stick with it for a few more weeks and I promise you it gets better! For anyone on the fence about it, just be aware that you may have this issue at first but like I told the current users, you get used to the keyboard after a short while!Alright here's the Pros/Cons list: The Cons: - The narrow spacing between keys can lead to some accidental key presses in the early days of getting used to the keyboard - It isn't wireless (this may or may not be a con for some people, I personally don't care much) - Um... I think that's it?And the Pros: - Typing is pretty quiet compared to a lot of other keyboards! My roommate said he was glad I switched to this keyboard finally just because he could finally read in peace haha. Combine this keyboard with the Emopeak silent mouse and you've got a nice quiet setup, though that mouse may be a bit small for some people. - The ever-so-silky smooth volume knob! I honestly can't get over how nice the knob is. It has the perfect amount of resistance when turning it, its metal construction makes it feel very premium, and if you want to mute the volume, you can just press it down to mute instead of turning the knob to the left. I refuse to get another keyboard that doesn't have a volume knob. - The individually-backlit keys! There's plenty of lighting pattern customisation, from the speed of the animations to the brightness as well---and of course there is the ability to have the keys constantly illuminated or not at all. - The ability to set a PIN to unlock the keyboard when turning it on--to prevent any unwanted users accessing your keyboard/PC - Low profile makes it a good entry-level keyboard for long-time laptop users wanting to get into the desktop world. - Very portable since it has a low profile, isn't very large, and the USB-C to USB-A cable is detachable. - Media control buttons in the top right of the keyboard! I'd've preferred the Play button to be between the Previous and Next buttons instead of the button order being Play, Previous, Next. They still work great though and I love using these in conjunction with the volume knob when listening to music. - Also the calculator button, right next to the media control buttons. Didn't think this was something I'd put on the list of pros for a keyboard review but honestly I use it far more often than I ever thought I would. - Great build quality! I saw a previous 1-star review saying that many keys stopped working for them after a few weeks or months of use but I've been using my keyboard for 12-13 hours almost every single day now for over a year and I have had absolutely ZERO problems in all that time.So I'm not sure what that person may or may not have done to their keyboard or if they just happen to have received a faulty model but their case about their keyboard is definitely not something you should expect to find with your keyboard.Who knows, maybe they didn't read the manual and accidentally locked themselves out of their keyboard haha.Features: 10/10Ergonomics: Initial Use - 6/10, Later Use - 9/10Build Quality: 10/10 (so far still holding up with no issues whatsoever over a year later of constant usage)Portability: 10/10Would Recommend: 13.5/10",true,1,16,"115","B082FTSMNP","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,94.99,"USD",0,0,0,51,3.9,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082FTSMNP","198.90",false,false,false,false,"iKBC Typemaster X410 White Backlit LED Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Low Profile Red Switch for Windows/Mac, Full Siz...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FSVQ1JkxL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

To many times have I gone from one video with super quiet audio to another that wants to blow my speakers. Having an audio dial that accessible is the solution I needed.Cons:I have at least three key switches that are causing issues after 3 months.The tab key either doesn't work at all or ""bounces"" (detects multiple triggers when only struck once) and sends multiple tab keys. As someone who uses tab to move between fields when filling forms and auto completing text, this has become quite a nuisance. Autocomplete in gmail has turned into auto-send an email before I'm done typing it.the shift key (and yes that non-capital at the beginning of this sentence is the issue) fails to work about one in ten times. Half the time I catch it and go back and have to fix it - slowing me down.The ""j"" key is super sensitive meaning if I brush it when putting my hands on the keyboard or while typing around it, I end up with a random j in the middle of the page.In short, I can't recomjmend this keyboard.

Enter the iKBC cherry mx red tkl keyboard. Even after using mechanical keyboards for almost a year now, I still prefer thesatisfying tactile feedback of brown switches, nonetheless, the typing experience on the iKBC takes a little getting used to if you are coming from more traditional keyboards. The 3 biggest differences for me were the height of the keyboard (very comfortable without a wrist rest), the size of the keys (they look like they have been squashed down by Wreck it Ralph) and the unique sizing of the spacebar, enter and backspace keys. The keycaps are not that great and have no texture on top. They are quite smooth and if you have any moisture on your fingers, it will show a glossy reflection on the caps. This keyboard is so silent, especially for a mechanical keyboard! and It comes with a volume wheel. This is the only reason I spend an extra $25 on this keyboard over another low-profile tkl that uses a micro usb connection.

Odd S/N.","The keyboard itself has been incredible, which is why I left 3 stars, more on that soon.When it arrived, I was extremely excited to open its brand new packaging and most likely rate it 5 stars.However, it arrived with tamper stickers that definitely looked like the package had been opened at least once, and the manual listed on the box was missing. As a lesser concern, the serial number also didn't look anything like those listed in their website's software downloads.Opened tamper seals and not receiving everything listed on the box are generally huge red flags to me, which tend to be signs of refurbished items. Aside from that, it just seems like a product at full price should come in professional packaging with all the promised parts. If things have changed from what the packaging indicates, they could at least add a sticker stating that new products will have opened seals and missing manuals. For now, I'm not sure if my product is refurbished or used even though I payed full price.The keyboard itself works extremely well, and the brown switches feel wonderful to type on. The spacebar has a very light chirp when pressed, and I'm not sure if that's a sign of a refurbished item with a quirk in the stabilizer or if it's normal. However, it's barely noticeable and probably wouldn'taffect the review stars if I were certain it arrived brand new. There has been no key chatter, the keys feel very stable and crisp, and the build quality has been fantastic. The LEDs and the software have worked in a stable manner, even though it required downloading the ""other"" version of the GMMK software on their site, because the serial is very different from any of the mentioned ones. The small size of the TKL model feels much nicer than I expected it to and leaves a lot of desk space free compared to my old Razer BlackWidow.The product probably would have easily gotten 5/5, but it's unclear whether it's new and I'm not interested in refurbished products at full price even if they've only been touched once by a different owner, wearing gloves. There's a reason I purchase things new at full price.However, I refuse to deal with shipping hassles even if it's refurbished, and I also don't want to go without this type of keyboard while waiting for another, so it seems stuck here either way.It's a fantastic keyboard and I'd like to be certain it arrived brand new and not refurbished.

"R2QIY91B3IF6V8","Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2021",5,"I love this keyboard.It isn't perfect, but I would certainly buy it again.","Reviewing the Glorious GMMK TKL (87 key) RGB model, black version, bought populated (not bare bones) through Amazon. The board is for my own use, I am not a paid reviewer. This is my third mechanical keyboard, and is by far the best of the three (vs Corsair & Rantopad).The keyboard feels solid and well-built. I have only had the board a few weeks so cannot comment on reliability. One reviewer mentioned ESD susceptibility in winter, so I plan to take ESD precautions in dry weather.Regarding the furnished keycaps, the translucent letters do not diffuse light as much as you'd think, so the lighting is considerably brighter when I sit up above the keyboard than it is if I slouch. This may be different if you use different keycaps. The keycap font is odd, but to me only a few keys are actually annoying:&, 8, 0, O, D and B.I can live with this for the time being; maybe in a year or so I will get new keycaps but I am not in a hurry.The RGB lighting is good, with only minor light bleed around the keys. If you want lots of light shining around the keys, buy a set of ""pudding"" keycaps (offered with the bare-bones version) that have clear surrounds; but personally I would find this distracting. But my keyboard sits next to a large north-facing window, lots of ambient light, and the keys are plenty bright for me.The stock Gateron Brown switches are very smooth, more smooth than their namesake Cherry MX Browns which feel scratchy to me. But in exchange for the smooth feel they are not very tactile, and pretty light (48 grams tactile peak, 36 grams at actuation and 52 grams to bottom).I am fine with this, but some people might want switches that are stiffer, perhaps more tactile, or perhaps clicky. If so, consider buying the bare-bones version of the board and adding the preferred switches separately.I am happy with the stock brown switches. I put some stiffer, clicky switches (Gateron green) in just a few places like caps lock and the windows & menu keys where I want to feel & hear when I've accidentally pressed one. Sawpping the switches out was easy.The software to set up custom key colors is OK but not well documented. I have had some problems with color profiles disappearing when the computer is restarted. Helpful hint: the ""Apply"" button doesn't acknowledge when you click it, but click it anyway. Otherwise the profile you've been working on may not be saved. Also be sure to close edit mode on one profile before opening another (you can have three profiles).PROS:>Well-built, quiet board>My connector is USB-C (I have the TKL 87-key board, bought August 2021)>Per-key RGB lighting with ability to switch between 3 custom lighting profiles>Can change switches without soldering / unsoldering – I have done this and it is easy>Can be purchased as bare-bones, allowing separate choice of switches and keycapsCONS:>USB-C connector fits rather loose and is easily bumped.>Software to program per-key colors has issues with save & restore, if you do subtle colors that aren't in the furnished 48-color palette you may need to write down RGB values and re-enter them.>The lighting is bright when viewed from above, but it is rather directional so it looks less bright (bu still bright enough) if I slouch back in my chair. Keycaps with more diffusive windows might help this.",true,1,17,"116","B071KGHZY4","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,1270,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071KGHZY4","5969.00",false,false,false,false,"Glorious GMMK Modular Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - TENKEYLESS (87 Key) - RGB LED Backlit, Brown Switches, Hot Swap Switche...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fRiLZccdL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

For people who know that they're using it in an area with reduced/no wireless 'noise', this is a great board - but if not, I'd suggest looking at something wired instead.

I've been geeking out on them since, and have tried several, with wireless being my essential requirement.As keyboard geeks know, this limits the selection.

The dongle/2.4 setup is best for wireless.These Cherry Blues are heavenly and this iKBC keyboard is the One. The wireless works perfectly with no perceptible lag when I'm typing at 100 wpm.

"R1EWIX4Y6FOEQW","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2021",5,"Small keycaps?Odd complaint","1.) ""Small"" keycaps.I was reading through the Amazon reviews on this keyboard and I was somewhat alarmed by the one that complained about the size of the keycaps.These keys are a very normal size.They width of the top of the key is .515"" according to my calipers (13mm).2.) With or without number pad?So I use this keyboard with either a mouse or a touchpad sitting just to the right of the keyboard.Since I use the mouse/touchpad so frequently, I find that the reduced distance I need to travel in order to get to the keyboard/mouse is wonderful, so I recommend omitting the number pad.I have a second keyboard that has a number pad that I can pull out if I have a bunch of number data entry to do, but for daily typing tasks, I don't feel like I'm missing much by not having the number pad.3.) Feeling of the key action (aka the switches).I got the Cherry MX brown switches.They seem great, but I'm not a mechanical switch aficionado.I would love to have tried them all out side by side, but I'm happy with the browns.They aren't too loud, but they're definitely not silent.My laptop keyboard and my other keyboard (Microsoft wireless bluetooth keyboard) are both virtually silent.4.) Typing speed.I type pretty quickly, and although I feel like I'm still getting used to this bad boy, I find that the responsiveness is very good, and I did a quick typing test online to see the how I was doing on the new keys.The Microsoft keyboard requires quite a bit of force to depress each key.The Cherry browns are definitely a much lighter actuation force.I found that I was immediately able to type about 15-20% faster which I attribute mostly to the lighter key actuation force and the solidity of the keyboard.5.) Build quality.Last thing I'll mention is that this keyboard is heavy.It feels well built and I suspect that it will last me for a long long time.Maybe (hopefully) a lifetime.6.) Scratchiness on the keystroke.There was a complaint from another reviewer that the keys felt a little scratchy on the way down as they are being depressed (They compared the feeling to another mechanical keyboard that they had used which felt ""silky smooth"").I notice this as well.I'm not sure if it bothers me, but I agree that it is noticeable.All that said, I have only had the keyboard for a day, so take it with a grain of salt.We'll see what I think in a year about this guy.",true,1,7,"16","B084GMTKK9","keyboard IKBC CD87",false,96.99,"USD",0,0,0,58,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084GMTKK9","237.80",false,false,false,false,"iKBC W200 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Blue Switch for Windows and Mac OS, Enables Media Key and LED Indica...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TLUqMDYzL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R8YQ1G7VUH60Q","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021",5,"Phenomenal! ...But Takes Some Getting Used To","Okay so I absolutely love this keyboard, no doubt about that now. It wasn't like that at first though.I initially purchased the keyboard for my first gaming desktop PC (avid longtime PC gamer, putting in 80-90 hours every week on average back on my gaming laptops) and I liked the black/white aesthetic that matched my PC and speakers, but also because of its minimalist design and THE VOLUME KNOB <3Upon first getting it and using it however, I found myself accidentally pressing other keys by accident because they aren't spaced very far apart and don't take a lot of force to press. Honestly I almost considered returning it after a few days because I hated all the misspellings I was making and having to correct.After a few weeks of usage though I suddenly realised that I wasn't making misspellings hardly at all anymore and my fingers had already memorised the placement of all the keys so I don't even look at the keyboard when I type now.So for anyone who just got this keyboard and is having a similar issue, just stick with it for a few more weeks and I promise you it gets better! For anyone on the fence about it, just be aware that you may have this issue at first but like I told the current users, you get used to the keyboard after a short while!Alright here's the Pros/Cons list: The Cons: - The narrow spacing between keys can lead to some accidental key presses in the early days of getting used to the keyboard - It isn't wireless (this may or may not be a con for some people, I personally don't care much) - Um... I think that's it?And the Pros: - Typing is pretty quiet compared to a lot of other keyboards! My roommate said he was glad I switched to this keyboard finally just because he could finally read in peace haha. Combine this keyboard with the Emopeak silent mouse and you've got a nice quiet setup, though that mouse may be a bit small for some people. - The ever-so-silky smooth volume knob! I honestly can't get over how nice the knob is. It has the perfect amount of resistance when turning it, its metal construction makes it feel very premium, and if you want to mute the volume, you can just press it down to mute instead of turning the knob to the left. I refuse to get another keyboard that doesn't have a volume knob. - The individually-backlit keys! There's plenty of lighting pattern customisation, from the speed of the animations to the brightness as well---and of course there is the ability to have the keys constantly illuminated or not at all. - The ability to set a PIN to unlock the keyboard when turning it on--to prevent any unwanted users accessing your keyboard/PC - Low profile makes it a good entry-level keyboard for long-time laptop users wanting to get into the desktop world. - Very portable since it has a low profile, isn't very large, and the USB-C to USB-A cable is detachable. - Media control buttons in the top right of the keyboard! I'd've preferred the Play button to be between the Previous and Next buttons instead of the button order being Play, Previous, Next. They still work great though and I love using these in conjunction with the volume knob when listening to music. - Also the calculator button, right next to the media control buttons. Didn't think this was something I'd put on the list of pros for a keyboard review but honestly I use it far more often than I ever thought I would. - Great build quality! I saw a previous 1-star review saying that many keys stopped working for them after a few weeks or months of use but I've been using my keyboard for 12-13 hours almost every single day now for over a year and I have had absolutely ZERO problems in all that time.So I'm not sure what that person may or may not have done to their keyboard or if they just happen to have received a faulty model but their case about their keyboard is definitely not something you should expect to find with your keyboard.Who knows, maybe they didn't read the manual and accidentally locked themselves out of their keyboard haha.Features: 10/10Ergonomics: Initial Use - 6/10, Later Use - 9/10Build Quality: 10/10 (so far still holding up with no issues whatsoever over a year later of constant usage)Portability: 10/10Would Recommend: 13.5/10",true,1,8,"17","B082FTSMNP","keyboard IKBC CD87",false,94.99,"USD",0,0,0,51,3.9,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082FTSMNP","198.90",false,false,false,false,"iKBC Typemaster X410 White Backlit LED Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Low Profile Red Switch for Windows/Mac, Full Siz...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FSVQ1JkxL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

To many times have I gone from one video with super quiet audio to another that wants to blow my speakers. Having an audio dial that accessible is the solution I needed.Cons:I have at least three key switches that are causing issues after 3 months.The tab key either doesn't work at all or ""bounces"" (detects multiple triggers when only struck once) and sends multiple tab keys. As someone who uses tab to move between fields when filling forms and auto completing text, this has become quite a nuisance. Autocomplete in gmail has turned into auto-send an email before I'm done typing it.the shift key (and yes that non-capital at the beginning of this sentence is the issue) fails to work about one in ten times. Half the time I catch it and go back and have to fix it - slowing me down.The ""j"" key is super sensitive meaning if I brush it when putting my hands on the keyboard or while typing around it, I end up with a random j in the middle of the page.In short, I can't recomjmend this keyboard.

Enter the iKBC cherry mx red tkl keyboard. Even after using mechanical keyboards for almost a year now, I still prefer thesatisfying tactile feedback of brown switches, nonetheless, the typing experience on the iKBC takes a little getting used to if you are coming from more traditional keyboards. The 3 biggest differences for me were the height of the keyboard (very comfortable without a wrist rest), the size of the keys (they look like they have been squashed down by Wreck it Ralph) and the unique sizing of the spacebar, enter and backspace keys. The keycaps are not that great and have no texture on top. They are quite smooth and if you have any moisture on your fingers, it will show a glossy reflection on the caps. This keyboard is so silent, especially for a mechanical keyboard! and It comes with a volume wheel. This is the only reason I spend an extra $25 on this keyboard over another low-profile tkl that uses a micro usb connection.

I have been hunting a descent backlit TLK keyboard with Cherry Silent Black switch type for years. Most MK doesn't offer this switch type, which leaves me frustrated. The moment I found this Durgod Taurus K320 TKL with Cherry MX Silent Black was the moment that a dream finally came true. Major keyboard companies would sell an MX silent red, a lighter version. Whereas the Silent Black variants usually lost popularity and went out of stock. What a nightmare for someone like me - someone who plays the heavy keys. Those butterfly red switches are just not my taste.Speaking of the build quality, the best descriptions are sturdiness and elegance. I love the font of the letters on the keycaps. They are simple, clean, and professional-looking. I seriously dislike the lousy and overly exaggerating fonts founded on the keycaps of other brands' gaming keyboards. The keycaps are a perfect fit for the Cherry MX switches, made of double-shot PBT. They feel great to type on. In sum, I love this keyboard for two reasons. First, it offers a rare switch I enjoy. Second, the build quality is excellent.One minor problem I have is that the included USB-C to USB-C cable seems to be flawed. It doesn't have a very stable connection to my laptop and randomly disconnects. Amazon resolved it for me by giving me a new USB-C cable for free.

The K320 is my 5th such keyboard and is by far my favorite! Though more expensive than some other options,BUILD QUALITYWhile the frame is plastic, it's a very durable plastic that is quite rigid, giving an overall ""well-built"" feel. There's no appreciable ""deck flex"" even with good pressure. The included keycaps are solid - with some other keyboards that I've bought on Amazon, I've noticed that the keycaps can be quite thin - with clear printing. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have any issues with the quality of printing on some of the keys. The included USB C cables seem well-built, though braided cables would've been a nice touch. Overall, though, the board seems durable, and I'm not worried about its ability to stand the test of time. 5/5PERFORMANCEI went with the Cherry Brown switches. This is my first board with Cherry Brown switches and I absolutely love them! Very nice tactile feel with a satisfying - but not deafening - click. They're heavy - and I do notice that my typing is about 10% slower compared to ""faster"" switches - but for long typing sessions, I do prefer the heavier actuation weight of the Brown switch.Other than the switches, this board performs as-expected. I haven't had any issues with an unstable USB connection, missed key presses, or any other issues with the individual switches themselves. This board is an absolute pleasure to type with. In fact, I bought it originally for my office, but I ended up loving it so much that I took it home and used one of my other keyboards for my office instead.I didn't try Durgod's firmware update tool so I can't speak about issues related to firmware upgrades. I didn't really see the point since I didn't have any issues with the board out of the box. 5/5OVERALLIf, like me, you're on the quest for a perfect keyboard for your PC setup, put this on your short list.

A non-removable palm rest. And idk bout y'all but when I game, it's in the pitch black darkness. I need backlit keys or light of some kind! I'm good on this one. Returned and getting the 915 with beautiful clicky keys.And since I got the combo. the MX Master is not a BAD mouse either... it's ergonomically fitting to my hand, a nice change to the sometimes too-small gaming mice that Logitech designs for my bigger hands.. But the side scroll is defunct and the forward/back buttons are literally on top of each other in a diagonal fashion. This makes it very tough to hit the correct button the first time.

The switches would routinely duplicate the letters, and at one point even the backspace key failed (same style switch). Thankfully the switches are replaceable with a little soldering skill, but this is a real nuisance. Because I was in a rush (and thinking Logitech may have just gotten a bad batch of switches during assembly), I bought a second keyboard, identical model, different batch. STILL having switch failures. On the original keyboard I have now replaced a total of EIGHT switches, on the newer one I've had to replace two.Until/unless Logitech gets better switches I would avoid this keyboard. I didn't bother going through customer service because I knew I could repair this issue myself, but not everyone has the tools or is handy. If you're handy and don't mind replacing switches, I've otherwise enjoyed the keyboard. Keystrokes are nice, responsiveness is excellent, and the range of the wireless is great.

Since the price difference is less than 10 dollars? if you decide to buy your own switches and keycaps, you'll be spending way more than 10 on switches alone, so think about that before making your decision.Now, aside from this observation between the two which are essentially the same keyboard - do I recommend it? No. The mechanical keyboard market keeps getting bigger and more accessible every month, I firmly believe there is better keyboards in this price range with better build quality and much more features for beginners or pros. I've been collecting and building keyboards for the past two years and one thing I've learned the hard way is looks don't conquer functionality and reliability.

There were actually some brownish red stains on it.It looked a little like dry blood.I was able to wipe off most of it.I am not sure what it was but hopefully nothing to worry about.Inserting the switches were easy and everything worked painlessly.My biggest downside is the build quality.Honestly the build is quite bad.I am not sure if I just got a defective unit but one of the acrylic plates particularly the one on top sadly seems to be shorter than the others in a noticeable way as can be seen by my photos.Actually all the plates seem to be slightly off in size and dont align perfectly.But honestly it's not really a deal breaker for me. I am still satisfied with the purchase but I think its worth mentioning.It does still feel quite solid with little flex.Just as an FYI.I am using Kailh Box Jade Switches with cherry profile pbt keycaps.Overall despite my issues, I can still recommend this keyboard.It is mostly because there arent many other options like this that are readily available.I do wish there was some better quality control.I mean, the PCB shouldn't have had any mystery stains on it and the acrylic plates should have been better aligned or at least the same size.",true,1,14,"113","B083H1RBHZ","keyboard IKBC CD87",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,12,3.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083H1RBHZ","43.20",false,false,false,false,"hot swappable YC66 PCB Custom Mechanical Keyboard RGB SMD Switch LEDs Type c USB Port with Acrylic case RGB Side Light (YC...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rJ-wpu7FL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

For people who know that they're using it in an area with reduced/no wireless 'noise', this is a great board - but if not, I'd suggest looking at something wired instead.

I did not know mechanical keyboards were a thing until this past month. I've been geeking out on them since, and have tried several, with wireless being my essential requirement.As keyboard geeks know, this limits the selection. I sampled several different brands (with Brown, Red, and Topre switches) but was not too impressed and sent each of them back. Some used Bluetooth and establishing connections was not always easy. The dongle/2.4 setup is best for wireless.These Cherry Blues are heavenly and this iKBC keyboard is the One. The wireless works perfectly with no perceptible lag when I'm typing at 100 wpm.

"R1EWIX4Y6FOEQW","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2021",5,"Small keycaps?Odd complaint","1.) ""Small"" keycaps.I was reading through the Amazon reviews on this keyboard and I was somewhat alarmed by the one that complained about the size of the keycaps.These keys are a very normal size.They width of the top of the key is .515"" according to my calipers (13mm).2.) With or without number pad?So I use this keyboard with either a mouse or a touchpad sitting just to the right of the keyboard.Since I use the mouse/touchpad so frequently, I find that the reduced distance I need to travel in order to get to the keyboard/mouse is wonderful, so I recommend omitting the number pad.I have a second keyboard that has a number pad that I can pull out if I have a bunch of number data entry to do, but for daily typing tasks, I don't feel like I'm missing much by not having the number pad.3.) Feeling of the key action (aka the switches).I got the Cherry MX brown switches.They seem great, but I'm not a mechanical switch aficionado.I would love to have tried them all out side by side, but I'm happy with the browns.They aren't too loud, but they're definitely not silent.My laptop keyboard and my other keyboard (Microsoft wireless bluetooth keyboard) are both virtually silent.4.) Typing speed.I type pretty quickly, and although I feel like I'm still getting used to this bad boy, I find that the responsiveness is very good, and I did a quick typing test online to see the how I was doing on the new keys.The Microsoft keyboard requires quite a bit of force to depress each key.The Cherry browns are definitely a much lighter actuation force.I found that I was immediately able to type about 15-20% faster which I attribute mostly to the lighter key actuation force and the solidity of the keyboard.5.) Build quality.Last thing I'll mention is that this keyboard is heavy.It feels well built and I suspect that it will last me for a long long time.Maybe (hopefully) a lifetime.6.) Scratchiness on the keystroke.There was a complaint from another reviewer that the keys felt a little scratchy on the way down as they are being depressed (They compared the feeling to another mechanical keyboard that they had used which felt ""silky smooth"").I notice this as well.I'm not sure if it bothers me, but I agree that it is noticeable.All that said, I have only had the keyboard for a day, so take it with a grain of salt.We'll see what I think in a year about this guy.",true,1,1,"10","B084GMXD3S","keyboard IKBC W200",false,96.99,"USD",0,0,0,58,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084GMXD3S","237.80",false,false,false,false,"iKBC W200 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Brown Switch for Windows and Mac OS, Enables Media Key and LED Indic...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TLUqMDYzL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R8YQ1G7VUH60Q","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021",5,"Phenomenal! ...But Takes Some Getting Used To","Okay so I absolutely love this keyboard, no doubt about that now. It wasn't like that at first though.I initially purchased the keyboard for my first gaming desktop PC (avid longtime PC gamer, putting in 80-90 hours every week on average back on my gaming laptops) and I liked the black/white aesthetic that matched my PC and speakers, but also because of its minimalist design and THE VOLUME KNOB <3Upon first getting it and using it however, I found myself accidentally pressing other keys by accident because they aren't spaced very far apart and don't take a lot of force to press. Honestly I almost considered returning it after a few days because I hated all the misspellings I was making and having to correct.After a few weeks of usage though I suddenly realised that I wasn't making misspellings hardly at all anymore and my fingers had already memorised the placement of all the keys so I don't even look at the keyboard when I type now.So for anyone who just got this keyboard and is having a similar issue, just stick with it for a few more weeks and I promise you it gets better! For anyone on the fence about it, just be aware that you may have this issue at first but like I told the current users, you get used to the keyboard after a short while!Alright here's the Pros/Cons list: The Cons: - The narrow spacing between keys can lead to some accidental key presses in the early days of getting used to the keyboard - It isn't wireless (this may or may not be a con for some people, I personally don't care much) - Um... I think that's it?And the Pros: - Typing is pretty quiet compared to a lot of other keyboards! My roommate said he was glad I switched to this keyboard finally just because he could finally read in peace haha. Combine this keyboard with the Emopeak silent mouse and you've got a nice quiet setup, though that mouse may be a bit small for some people. - The ever-so-silky smooth volume knob! I honestly can't get over how nice the knob is. It has the perfect amount of resistance when turning it, its metal construction makes it feel very premium, and if you want to mute the volume, you can just press it down to mute instead of turning the knob to the left. I refuse to get another keyboard that doesn't have a volume knob. - The individually-backlit keys! There's plenty of lighting pattern customisation, from the speed of the animations to the brightness as well---and of course there is the ability to have the keys constantly illuminated or not at all. - The ability to set a PIN to unlock the keyboard when turning it on--to prevent any unwanted users accessing your keyboard/PC - Low profile makes it a good entry-level keyboard for long-time laptop users wanting to get into the desktop world. - Very portable since it has a low profile, isn't very large, and the USB-C to USB-A cable is detachable. - Media control buttons in the top right of the keyboard! I'd've preferred the Play button to be between the Previous and Next buttons instead of the button order being Play, Previous, Next. They still work great though and I love using these in conjunction with the volume knob when listening to music. - Also the calculator button, right next to the media control buttons. Didn't think this was something I'd put on the list of pros for a keyboard review but honestly I use it far more often than I ever thought I would. - Great build quality! I saw a previous 1-star review saying that many keys stopped working for them after a few weeks or months of use but I've been using my keyboard for 12-13 hours almost every single day now for over a year and I have had absolutely ZERO problems in all that time.So I'm not sure what that person may or may not have done to their keyboard or if they just happen to have received a faulty model but their case about their keyboard is definitely not something you should expect to find with your keyboard.Who knows, maybe they didn't read the manual and accidentally locked themselves out of their keyboard haha.Features: 10/10Ergonomics: Initial Use - 6/10, Later Use - 9/10Build Quality: 10/10 (so far still holding up with no issues whatsoever over a year later of constant usage)Portability: 10/10Would Recommend: 13.5/10",true,1,5,"14","B082FTSMNP","keyboard IKBC W200",false,94.99,"USD",0,0,0,51,3.9,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082FTSMNP","198.90",false,false,false,false,"iKBC Typemaster X410 White Backlit LED Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Low Profile Red Switch for Windows/Mac, Full Siz...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FSVQ1JkxL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Enter the iKBC cherry mx red tkl keyboard. Even after using mechanical keyboards for almost a year now, I still prefer thesatisfying tactile feedback of brown switches, nonetheless, the typing experience on the iKBC takes a little getting used to if you are coming from more traditional keyboards. The 3 biggest differences for me were the height of the keyboard (very comfortable without a wrist rest), the size of the keys (they look like they have been squashed down by Wreck it Ralph) and the unique sizing of the spacebar, enter and backspace keys. The keycaps are not that great and have no texture on top. They are quite smooth and if you have any moisture on your fingers, it will show a glossy reflection on the caps. This keyboard is so silent, especially for a mechanical keyboard! and It comes with a volume wheel. This is the only reason I spend an extra $25 on this keyboard over another low-profile tkl that uses a micro usb connection.

I can over look this but still worth noting.The two small things that irritate me the most about this keyboard is that because of the length of the spacebar and the fact that it's only supported under the middle, it sits tiled slightly and looks curved sometimes. The second thing is that I am able to click the key but not actually get the response from the switch underneath, so sometimes I get the audible click of the key but miss that fraction of length to also hit the switch to actually type the letter.Also there is one cntrl key with a small jagged edge on arrival.",true,1,12,"111","B01LVTI3TO","keyboard IKBC W200",true,59.99,"USD",99.99,40,40,9453,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LVTI3TO","44429.10",false,false,false,false,"Razer Ornata Chroma Gaming Keyboard: Hybrid Mechanical Key Switches - Customizable Chroma RGB Lighting - Individually Back...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/8116DtW4WWL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I have been hunting a descent backlit TLK keyboard with Cherry Silent Black switch type for years. Most MK doesn't offer this switch type, which leaves me frustrated. The moment I found this Durgod Taurus K320 TKL with Cherry MX Silent Black was the moment that a dream finally came true. Major keyboard companies would sell an MX silent red, a lighter version. Whereas the Silent Black variants usually lost popularity and went out of stock. What a nightmare for someone like me - someone who plays the heavy keys. Those butterfly red switches are just not my taste.Speaking of the build quality, the best descriptions are sturdiness and elegance. I love the font of the letters on the keycaps. They are simple, clean, and professional-looking. I seriously dislike the lousy and overly exaggerating fonts founded on the keycaps of other brands' gaming keyboards. The keycaps are a perfect fit for the Cherry MX switches, made of double-shot PBT. They feel great to type on. In sum, I love this keyboard for two reasons. First, it offers a rare switch I enjoy. Second, the build quality is excellent.One minor problem I have is that the included USB-C to USB-C cable seems to be flawed. It doesn't have a very stable connection to my laptop and randomly disconnects. Amazon resolved it for me by giving me a new USB-C cable for free. Hence, no complaints, though I hoped that the factory-given cable could work in the first place.",true,1,15,"114","B078H3WPHM","keyboard IKBC W200",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,2428,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078H3WPHM","11168.80",false,false,false,false,"Durgod Taurus K320 TKL Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - 87 Keys - Double Shot PBT - NKRO - USB Type C (Cherry Brown, Space Grey)","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/812-9gZiusL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"RMO9GLIWBKZ6Y","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2021",5,"One of my favorite keyboards yet!","Over the last several months, I've really gotten into portable mechanical keyboards. The K320 is my 5th such keyboard and is by far my favorite! Though more expensive than some other options,BUILD QUALITYWhile the frame is plastic, it's a very durable plastic that is quite rigid, giving an overall ""well-built"" feel. There's no appreciable ""deck flex"" even with good pressure. The included keycaps are solid - with some other keyboards that I've bought on Amazon, I've noticed that the keycaps can be quite thin - with clear printing. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have any issues with the quality of printing on some of the keys. The included USB C cables seem well-built, though braided cables would've been a nice touch. Overall, though, the board seems durable, and I'm not worried about its ability to stand the test of time. 5/5PERFORMANCEI went with the Cherry Brown switches. This is my first board with Cherry Brown switches and I absolutely love them! Very nice tactile feel with a satisfying - but not deafening - click. They're heavy - and I do notice that my typing is about 10% slower compared to ""faster"" switches - but for long typing sessions, I do prefer the heavier actuation weight of the Brown switch.Other than the switches, this board performs as-expected. I haven't had any issues with an unstable USB connection, missed key presses, or any other issues with the individual switches themselves. This board is an absolute pleasure to type with. In fact, I bought it originally for my office, but I ended up loving it so much that I took it home and used one of my other keyboards for my office instead.I didn't try Durgod's firmware update tool so I can't speak about issues related to firmware upgrades. I didn't really see the point since I didn't have any issues with the board out of the box. 5/5OVERALLIf, like me, you're on the quest for a perfect keyboard for your PC setup, put this on your short list. While I haven't entered the premium keyboard market - which I would define as $150-200+ - this is definitely the best keyboard in the $100 or less price point that I've tried so far.

Sort of removes any cost savings.For 100$ seems ok but would be way better of an option if it was hot swap.Lighting is good, key caps feel decent.

It's extremely solid, stays planted on my glass desk. Nothing feels cheap about it. It's fairly heavy. There is a magnetic ruler that is under the keyboard that is used to prop it up. I wish there was more adjustability for keyboard angle but, I can't knock a star off for that. It's such a great experience. Also, the cord is slightly ridgid and has a fairly large diameter. To some this may not mean much but, it doesn't appear to be something fragile. As in, my 3 year old could drag the keyboard around the house by the cord and I doubt the cord would be damage at all. One thing I can add (that may be something to look at in future revisions of this keyboard) is about the 'sleep, mute, previous, play/pause, next' buttons.

The cherry brown switches have a very light touch and soft tactile bump. If you have good form then they will work well. I am not a great typist so I tend to hit adjacent keys sometimes due to the high key height. Not the KB's fault. A good typist will love the quick feel and light touch. The fonts are very standard and easy to see.I noticed the ""s"" key started out scratchy but has improved after a few hours. I assume breaking in the KB will help but I would expect for the price all keys should be silky from the start. By scratchy I mean the key seems to have an annoying resistance/stick at the top of the stroke especially if you hit the key off-center. It is still about 50% noticeable after a few hours of continuous use.The height is adjusted by a ruler gimmick which now has feet to prevent sliding.

The keys are nice and responsive, they feel great and the quality of the switches are consistent between the keys. The red switches are decently quiet while still being satisfying with a low clunk while bottoming out the key, and it is quieter then my previous keyboard which is a selling point for me. One weird thing was that when I pulled my keyboard out of the box, I had to push down about half of the keys to make sure they were fully seated properly, but that wasn't a big deal.I picked up a Bluetooth receiver for my gaming desktop to use it wirelessly and reduce the amount of cable clutter and it has worked excellently. I haven't had any of the common connectivity issues such laggy inputs, missing inputs, double inputs, and I have multiple other wireless devices at my desk. For gaming, there is no noticeable latency over Bluetooth, even in fast-paced and reaction based games like FPS's. As long as you're not a heavy competitive gamer where the additional 10-20ms of wireless latency of Bluetooth 5.0 vs a wired connection could be an actual concern, I doubt you will ever notice it, but if that is something you care about then just keep it wired.I spent a long time researching wireless mechanical keyboard for both productivity and gaming. It was between this and the Logitech G915.

First of it connects to Mac and windows with a usb-c cable (most keyboard in this price point use mirco usb) and it comes with a type a adapter if you don’t have a type c connection. Also it comes with a GREAT key cap puller incase you need to swap some keys out. But the best thing of this keyboard I would say is the feel and the sound. This is a true mechanical keyboard unlike the fakes around this price range so it sound really nice and smooth (or clicky if you choose brown or blue switches) and this keyboard has to kickstand options on it so you can choose the most comfortable way to use it. One thing I will say is if you hit a key a little to hard sometimes it will make a whiny high pitch clang which can be annoying at times but it rarely ever happens.In conclusion this mechanical keyboard is by far the best keyboard you can get for 50 dollars as it offers many good features 100 keyboard DONT have.

If you don't like RGB, you can save a bit, if you want hot-swappable switches, you can pay a bit more, it works well enough for Mac and PC, the build quality is fantastic.I'm docking a star for two things:- The switches are a bit squeaky (this model is Gateron Brown)- The dedicated Siri/Cortana key is stupid and should be hardware-mappable to something less stupid. Luckily AutoHotKey/Karabiner existThe RGB effects are 99% ugly and unusable, but some of them look really good. I'd love a software-based tool for selecting exact colors to match with other RGB hardware, but for a built-in toggle system it's fairly flexible.The keycaps looked a bit ugly in the photos, but in person it's actually a beautiful keyboard. The keycap build quality is clearly to the same standard as the rest of the build, but as I didn't like the look in the photos, I did also buy a cheap pudding cap set that I replaced them with. It looks great with both the originals and the replacement caps, though the spacebar has limited backlighting for the translucent keycap base (very common, not really an issue).I would 100% recommend this keyboard to basically anyone at this price point.

You get used to not having a number pad pretty quickly as long as you aren't working in spreadsheets all day-Lower profile than Keychron's K series keyboards which is nice if you type with your wrists resting on your desk.Cons:-There is a little more play in the key caps than the razer keyboard I own (which has stabilizers built into each key) but I got used to it rather quickly-It can be a tad bit noisy when typing hard and bottoming out the keys, which is expected at this price point. Still sounds nice overall.-No wireless connectivity, which may be a deal-breaker for some but wasn't something I needed.To sum up, I would highly recommend this keyboard to anyone looking for a solid all-purpose mechanical tenkeyless keyboard.

"R21O5PWH3RJWTR","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021",5,"Solid Mac-first keyboard, with only a few caveats...","Since I needed new peripherals to go along with my new M1 Mac mini last November, after years of typing on flat MacBooks, I decided to finally treat myself to my first mechanical keyboard since the original IBM PC was offered with one.After a long online dive, when I surfaced I had decided on the 75% Keychron Wireless Backlit RGB with Brown switches and Aluminum Frame.For me, these Browns by Gateron are an acceptable compromise between mechanical feel and reasonable noise, just as long as you are okay with the lack any actual mechanical ""break"" when actuating. I prefer not waking up the house late at night!That being said, I do sometimes still miss a clearly felt mechanical actuation feel, but this works for me, and is still legions ahead of any membrane keyboard, or Apple's own.IThe keyboard is rather tall, but not exceptionally so.I use it with the rear feet extended for a more sloped typing angle, which helps.I ordered the matching Keychron Wooden Palm Rest in anticipation of this and it makes a big difference when I do serious typing.I also prefer the feel of the finished wood on my palms over spongy fabric covered palmrests, or the bare glass top of my desk. When just casually surfing the web or doing other non-typing-intensive tasks, I put away the palmrest since it just tends to get in the way if I have to move the keyboard around and have desk clutter.Bluetooth is rock-solid, with never a glitch or delay, ever.In fact the connection is far more reliable than with Apple's Magic Trackpad 2 that I bought at the same time.If I recall, I think I had to use a wired connection just once, to be able to boot up my brand new M1 Mac mini.This is a condition specific to only the M1 versions when using a non-Apple keyboard on a new machine.The RGB color options and patterns, though entertaining as heck at first, end up becoming more of a distraction after a while.I ended up using one preferred color pretty much all the time. Keyboard circus lights can be distracting!A note on the colors, specifically blue.Normally a color I might choose, this blue is not very bright, even when turned all the way up in the dark.I always end up using the brightest setting for all the colors, all the time, to get to a decent brightness level.Except for blue.I find it far too subtle.in my photos I use cyan/teal, which I like very much.Battery life with the RGB lighting activated is an issue, but it's addressed in the descriptions when you buy it.Expect to get a full day's use out of it, then plug it in overnight so you're ready to go in the morning.With the illumination turned off, it's much longer, maybe a few days.After nearly a year of use, I can say I am still satisfied with my purchase.I wish the lighting was a tad brighter, and the rubber on one of the folding feet has disappeared (a much bigger problem on the Keychron Palm Rest on which ALL of the pads slid right off it's base - a BIG problem since it'll wobble without!), but not enough suffer any buyers remorse.The keycaps still look good with crisp lettering, and they haven't acquired significant shine from use yet.Battery life is as purchased.it still looks and types great.Whether or not you consider it's reasonable cost vs. comparably featured keyboards from some others, it's a worthy purchase.Except for that one rubber foot-pad... When one falls off, you know more will eventually follow.Especially when you consider how awful they were on my Palmrest.I tried everything to get them to stick - unacceptable that they all fell off within a few weeks of purchase.Keychron, you make some good gear that I'm comfortable recommending to others.I want mine made right again; how does one get replacement feet, please?",true,1,8,"17","B07YB32H52","keyboard keychron k1",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,2623,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YB32H52","12065.80",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K2 Wireless Bluetooth/USB Wired Gaming Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys RGB LED Backlit N-Key Rollover Alumin...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614chmBNoqL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I recently tried a number of cheaper membrane keyboards, but never found one that I felt at home on. I had started seeing all the hype and talk about mechanical keyboards and was curious as to what all of the fuss was about. After doing some research, watching more YouTube videos than I care to admit, I took a leap and purchased a Keychron K3.As far as fit and form is concerned, I can honestly say that I love this keyboard so far. I opted for Blue Gateron low profile, non-hot swappable switches as I figured if I don't really like the feel, I'd send back and try something different. I am in my own closed office space, so noise is not a factor. Though, I will have to mute my mic when in virtual meetings and need to type notes.Two not so positive observations:1) I had read a number of not flattering reviews regarding the Bluetooth connectivity. I have found that connecting to my iPhone is ok, though my Dell XPS 13 has not been so crash hot.2) this be a peculiarity of the Gateron switch, but when you press down a key past the 'click' point, and then partially release it back up, you can actually continue to press it all the way back down and register clicks. I was under the impression that it had to fully release and go back down past the 'click' point to register the next keypress.Other than that, the key layout is a little different that what I am used to.

It needs to be more clearly advertised that the switches are not hotswappable. All switches are soldered on. Which is fine if this was a great keyboard out of the box, but:2. The stabilizers on this thing are BAD. Like, very mushy and unresponsive. The spacebar sticks constantly. Unless I absolutely slam it, I have a 50/50 shot of my keystroke actually registering. The other keys using stabilizers are mushy at best (e.g. enter, backspace, shift).The spacebar is relatively important, and the end result is a very bad keyboard. I will be ordering the hotswappable version direct from keychron's site because I think this would actually be a very good keyboard with upgraded stabilizers.

"R2ERQ372NMP7RX","Reviewed in Australia on March 24, 2021",,"Takes a little getting use to but it's a great little keyboard","These brown switches feel more stiff than the cherry brown switches I have on my corsair keyboard. But thats not low profile and so maybe thats the difference. Though it still feels like it's tougher than it should be.Otherwise this is a very neat nifty compact low profile keyboard. Loving it so far, been using it for about a day now and so far like the extra space and no numpad on the right.The low profile and space between the keys feel perfect otherwise.Notes for improvement:* Windows and Mac symbols on keys rather than actually having to replace them to get the symbol/icon for windows on them I switch between mac and windows very regularly and will not be swapping the key caps every time.* Some macro options without the use of software like the cooler master k622 does.* Though the width of the keyboard is great, I find I keep hitting the arrow key instead of the right shift. So maybe for me a layout like the K1 but with the low profile and design of this K3. Or better yet something in between as I would like the del and ins to be separate keys.Finally this would be 5 stars if the keys felt softer or not as stiff to press on these brown switches and insert and del being separate keys with a full width right shift key.UPDATE: Weeks of using it now at my primary keyboard.* Still find the keys a little stiff compared to my corsair cherry mx browns* Switch between mac and windows mode is very annoying and not very easy to switch. I switch between mac and pc very often. Wish the switch was like switching between bluetooth devices, or easier then the switch on there now. Though I'm getting use to it I feel like I'm going to eventually damage it and not be able to switch between pc/mac. Question is which mode will I be left in when that happens. Anyways, really hoping it won't get wrecked.* The size and spacing have been great.* The active bluetooth is wonderful, switching between devices has been instant once active.* Would have been nice to configure the idle time before it turns off. It also turns off after 10 mins when connected via cable and using bluetooth. And turning this feature off is not a good option as the battery has not been so great on this device.Hoping for a Keychron 3 rev 2 with the above addressed, be the perfect keyboard for me if that happens.",true,1,14,"113","B08LYL2N4S","keyboard keychron k1",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,26,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LYL2N4S","117.00",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K3 Ultra-Slim 75% Layout Wireless Wired Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys Bluetooth RGB LED Backlit for Mac Wi...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KT0A6-cjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R21O5PWH3RJWTR","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021",5,"Solid Mac-first keyboard, with only a few caveats...","Since I needed new peripherals to go along with my new M1 Mac mini last November, after years of typing on flat MacBooks, I decided to finally treat myself to my first mechanical keyboard since the original IBM PC was offered with one.After a long online dive, when I surfaced I had decided on the 75% Keychron Wireless Backlit RGB with Brown switches and Aluminum Frame.For me, these Browns by Gateron are an acceptable compromise between mechanical feel and reasonable noise, just as long as you are okay with the lack any actual mechanical ""break"" when actuating. I prefer not waking up the house late at night!That being said, I do sometimes still miss a clearly felt mechanical actuation feel, but this works for me, and is still legions ahead of any membrane keyboard, or Apple's own.IThe keyboard is rather tall, but not exceptionally so.I use it with the rear feet extended for a more sloped typing angle, which helps.I ordered the matching Keychron Wooden Palm Rest in anticipation of this and it makes a big difference when I do serious typing.I also prefer the feel of the finished wood on my palms over spongy fabric covered palmrests, or the bare glass top of my desk. When just casually surfing the web or doing other non-typing-intensive tasks, I put away the palmrest since it just tends to get in the way if I have to move the keyboard around and have desk clutter.Bluetooth is rock-solid, with never a glitch or delay, ever.In fact the connection is far more reliable than with Apple's Magic Trackpad 2 that I bought at the same time.If I recall, I think I had to use a wired connection just once, to be able to boot up my brand new M1 Mac mini.This is a condition specific to only the M1 versions when using a non-Apple keyboard on a new machine.The RGB color options and patterns, though entertaining as heck at first, end up becoming more of a distraction after a while.I ended up using one preferred color pretty much all the time. Keyboard circus lights can be distracting!A note on the colors, specifically blue.Normally a color I might choose, this blue is not very bright, even when turned all the way up in the dark.I always end up using the brightest setting for all the colors, all the time, to get to a decent brightness level.Except for blue.I find it far too subtle.in my photos I use cyan/teal, which I like very much.Battery life with the RGB lighting activated is an issue, but it's addressed in the descriptions when you buy it.Expect to get a full day's use out of it, then plug it in overnight so you're ready to go in the morning.With the illumination turned off, it's much longer, maybe a few days.After nearly a year of use, I can say I am still satisfied with my purchase.I wish the lighting was a tad brighter, and the rubber on one of the folding feet has disappeared (a much bigger problem on the Keychron Palm Rest on which ALL of the pads slid right off it's base - a BIG problem since it'll wobble without!), but not enough suffer any buyers remorse.The keycaps still look good with crisp lettering, and they haven't acquired significant shine from use yet.Battery life is as purchased.it still looks and types great.Whether or not you consider it's reasonable cost vs. comparably featured keyboards from some others, it's a worthy purchase.Except for that one rubber foot-pad... When one falls off, you know more will eventually follow.Especially when you consider how awful they were on my Palmrest.I tried everything to get them to stick - unacceptable that they all fell off within a few weeks of purchase.Keychron, you make some good gear that I'm comfortable recommending to others.I want mine made right again; how does one get replacement feet, please?",true,1,2,"11","B07YB32H52","keyboard keychron k2",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,2623,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YB32H52","12065.80",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K2 Wireless Bluetooth/USB Wired Gaming Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys RGB LED Backlit N-Key Rollover Alumin...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614chmBNoqL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Been using a Kira for the past couple of years and before that, I had a crappy (but handsome) Excalibur 75% kb, this one is very nice. The only things I don't like about the keyboard is:- Lights reset whenever I switch machines or switch to Bluetooth. I have the keyboard attached to a KVM switch, whenever I switch the KVM to another machine. I'm not big on keyboard lights as I don't use shine-through keycaps. So it's pointless to have them on- Bluetooth is severely borked. It lags, types randomly by itself (usually the last key you pressed), its especially annoying when it gets stuck on backspace as it will delete everything you've typed until you hit another key.- The plastic case is plastic. I would have loved either a low-profile case or a metal one. I would have paid extra for either of those options. That being said, although it's plastic, and looks rather cheap, it's pretty solid and doesn't make weird plasticie noises when typing.If you use this keyboard with it plugged directly, it's great!

If you purely use it for gaming you might never even notice an issue. But if you use it for any kind of typing - writing, coding, etc. - you will notice after a few months that it begins to exhibit an issue where keystrokes are duplicated. This is referred to as ""key chattering"" and if you search for ""Drop Ctrl key chattering"" you'll find that it's a very common issue with these keyboards, with no real fix. It makes this keyboard incredibly frustrating to use for work (coding) because it significantly increases typos due to the random duplicated letters while typing.Drop has released several firmware updates that they claim resolve the issue, but none actually do. They seem unwilling to admit that it's a hardware issue and continue to sell a faulty product. They also are not willing to provide support for the product when it's purchased from Amazon instead of their own website. Because of this, I'm avoiding the Drop brand entirely in the future since they seem unwilling to stand behind their products.There are a lot of good options for keyboards in the $100-200 range. This keyboard is already pricey for what it is, but the key chattering issue is just a complete deal breaker.

"R2MWVP81TRK45V","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021",3,"Wanted to love it but it just didn't work out","I was looking for a budget-friendly mechanical keyboard and really wanted to love the k8 as so many of my friends recommended Keychron as one of the best first mechanical keyboards for their price and quality. Granted the version my friends purchased was the K2, I wanted dedicated arrows and opted for the K8.First off, if based on typing alone... out of the other keyboards I've tried, I've mistyped the least on the K8. I actually truly enjoyed typing on here and loved that there was an option to level the keyboard. My fingers felt pretty natural typing and I haven't had to look down on my keyboard yet. The simple white backlight is nice, nothing too fancy like the RGB (which is nice to look at but my eyes will be glued to the screen and wouldn't be able to enjoy it anyways). My main intended use for the K8 was to be able to one day bring it to work and use it as my dedicated work keyboard.Now for the bad... as much as I love how my hands fall naturally on the keyboard... out of the box there is a persistent ping and/or squeaking on certain keys, wobble or rattle on larger keys like the space bar. Also a little wonky connection when using Bluetooth. Unfortunately for this keyboard set for the price, I was hoping to have a better experience. Unfortunately, it seems like I would have to do a lot of work on the keyboard to fix a lot of these QA issues. Another thing to note, although the keycaps feel nice to touch, with the matte finish you can clearly see your finger oils on them. Which again, is a bit unfortunate.Overall, I'm sure what I received could be a dud, I wouldn't take it out of the running completely. Still could be a worthy contender for an 87 keyboard. It would just require more time, effort, and money to get the keyboard where I need it to be.

"R26YTKL47B2YCC","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2021",5,"I love this keyboard and I couldn't be happier with my purchase","First of all, I'm no mechanical keyboard aficionado. It's just that I was looking towards mechanical keyboards because the keyboard I had been using had seen its better days behind it (Logitech K740), I was having trouble typing accurately on it, and I had heard so much about mechanical keyboards these days.What appealed to me about the K8 was that I could replace the keys and switches (I opted for Gateron browns), that it was backlit (I opted for the model with white lighting), the 10-keyless layout, and that it had Bluetooth support for up to 3 devices. This would allow me to easily switch between my Mac and my PC. The combination of this keyboard and my MX Master 3 mouse (which has the same ability to pair with multiple devices) has been a winning combination.I only use the keyboard for office type work (documents, programming) and also some creativity apps (Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere). No gaming to speak of.Things that I like:* The general feel of the keyboard. I can't explain it, but I find myself getting a certain satisfaction from typing on this keyboard. I find it strangely pleasurable. That may have more to do with the current state of my previous keyboard but the feeling is there nonetheless.* Backlighting. I often like to work with little light, so it is convenient.* Bluetooth. See above.* Comes with both Mac and Windows keys.* The fact that I can replace both they keycaps and the switches means that it should have a longer life, and I have more room for customization if I desire.* Has the ability to have the back of the keyboard sit at 3 different heights.Things I don't like:* It's very thick. I just got it and I haven't done any marathon typing sessions yet, so it remains to be seen whether I'm going to want to have a wrist rest. (My old keyboard had a bit of one built in, although it was really an ""edge of palm"" rest.)* It's really dumb the way the recharge cable is on the left side of the keyboard instead of the back of the keyboard. That just doesn't make any sense, especially considering how much room is inside this thing - they surely could have place some electronics in back and kept the switches (for OS and for communications between Bluetooth and USB) on the side.",true,1,10,"19","B0875VG9NL","keyboard keychron k2",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,286,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0875VG9NL","1258.40",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K8 Hot-swappable Wireless Bluetooth 5.1/Wired USB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Tenkeyless 87 Keys White LED Backli...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RWxES35ZL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I appreciate the fact that this still has the function keys as well as arrow keys. I sorely missed that on the Huntsman.The RGB was a nice surprise too, since I didn't realize this model came with it! I just have mine set to blue to match my PC build.Overall, 10/10. Initial impressions are very positive. Now to maintain and lube it, since that seems to be a very common suggestion among keeb enthusiasts.The only reason I didn't give it full marks for quality of material is because of the issues I mentioned with the backspace key and the fact that the spacebar is doing the same.

It needs to be more clearly advertised that the switches are not hotswappable. All switches are soldered on. Which is fine if this was a great keyboard out of the box, but:2. The stabilizers on this thing are BAD. Like, very mushy and unresponsive. The spacebar sticks constantly. Unless I absolutely slam it, I have a 50/50 shot of my keystroke actually registering. The other keys using stabilizers are mushy at best (e.g. enter, backspace, shift).The spacebar is relatively important, and the end result is a very bad keyboard. I will be ordering the hotswappable version direct from keychron's site because I think this would actually be a very good keyboard with upgraded stabilizers.

"R3JN8RTBH5N81U","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",4,"Where has this keyboard been my whole life?","I have been a Mac user for the last decade, typed on many types of keyboards. I recently tried a number of cheaper membrane keyboards, but never found one that I felt at home on. I had started seeing all the hype and talk about mechanical keyboards and was curious as to what all of the fuss was about. After doing some research, watching more YouTube videos than I care to admit, I took a leap and purchased a Keychron K3.As far as fit and form is concerned, I can honestly say that I love this keyboard so far. I opted for Blue Gateron low profile, non-hot swappable switches as I figured if I don't really like the feel, I'd send back and try something different. I am in my own closed office space, so noise is not a factor. Though, I will have to mute my mic when in virtual meetings and need to type notes.Two not so positive observations:1) I had read a number of not flattering reviews regarding the Bluetooth connectivity. I have found that connecting to my iPhone is ok, though my Dell XPS 13 has not been so crash hot.2) this be a peculiarity of the Gateron switch, but when you press down a key past the 'click' point, and then partially release it back up, you can actually continue to press it all the way back down and register clicks. I was under the impression that it had to fully release and go back down past the 'click' point to register the next keypress.Other than that, the key layout is a little different that what I am used to. I find myself missing the Backace key and landing on the '=+' key.

"R2ERQ372NMP7RX","Reviewed in Australia on March 24, 2021",,"Takes a little getting use to but it's a great little keyboard","These brown switches feel more stiff than the cherry brown switches I have on my corsair keyboard. But thats not low profile and so maybe thats the difference. Though it still feels like it's tougher than it should be.Otherwise this is a very neat nifty compact low profile keyboard. Loving it so far, been using it for about a day now and so far like the extra space and no numpad on the right.The low profile and space between the keys feel perfect otherwise.Notes for improvement:* Windows and Mac symbols on keys rather than actually having to replace them to get the symbol/icon for windows on them I switch between mac and windows very regularly and will not be swapping the key caps every time.* Some macro options without the use of software like the cooler master k622 does.* Though the width of the keyboard is great, I find I keep hitting the arrow key instead of the right shift. So maybe for me a layout like the K1 but with the low profile and design of this K3. Or better yet something in between as I would like the del and ins to be separate keys.Finally this would be 5 stars if the keys felt softer or not as stiff to press on these brown switches and insert and del being separate keys with a full width right shift key.UPDATE: Weeks of using it now at my primary keyboard.* Still find the keys a little stiff compared to my corsair cherry mx browns* Switch between mac and windows mode is very annoying and not very easy to switch. I switch between mac and pc very often. Wish the switch was like switching between bluetooth devices, or easier then the switch on there now. Though I'm getting use to it I feel like I'm going to eventually damage it and not be able to switch between pc/mac. Question is which mode will I be left in when that happens. Anyways, really hoping it won't get wrecked.* The size and spacing have been great.* The active bluetooth is wonderful, switching between devices has been instant once active.* Would have been nice to configure the idle time before it turns off. It also turns off after 10 mins when connected via cable and using bluetooth. And turning this feature off is not a good option as the battery has not been so great on this device.Hoping for a Keychron 3 rev 2 with the above addressed, be the perfect keyboard for me if that happens.",true,1,3,"12","B08LYKWB5Q","keyboard keychron k3",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,26,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LYKWB5Q","117.00",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K3 Ultra-Slim 75% Layout Wireless Wired Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys RGB LED Backlit for Mac Windows, Low...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KT0A6-cjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2LAX6MXG4RH8F","Reviewed in Australia on August 16, 2021",,"Amazing first mechanical keyboard experience!","Absolutely in love with my Keychron K3v2 Keyboard with Optical Red switches!This is my very first mechanical keyboard as I've always used membrane laptop keyboards prior. It didn't take long to transition and I feel like my accuracy has improved, my fingers are still moving at lightning speeds and can spend longer periods typing without fatigue. As a first mechanical experience, the keys are very 'bouncy' and I sometimes don't need to bottom out to register the keys. This could be a little sensitive for heavier typists out there, but it shouldn't be a problem if you are a light touch typist like me.I also like its hot-swappable capability so I can try out brown and blue switches later down the track :) The sounds are less silent than laptop keyboards, but they sound like you are being efficient and feels ASMR! There are lots of RGB effects to choose from and the size is perfect for me, compact for on-the-go and has all the keys I need. There are also two back legs to change the angle of the keyboard. The function keys are also easily accessible on the F row like volume, pause/play, brightness, etc. There is also Bluetooth and cable mode, switchable with Windows/Mac. The cable mode makes the RBG lights brighter and has no lag compared to the Bluetooth mode (I see some lag when it wakes up from Sleep mode, which I have now turned off). The keycaps are low profile, so they are quite easy to take off without the keycap puller tool provided. I have tried using the switch puller tool too and it works well if you squeeze the switch tightly top and bottom before pulling it out.All in all, I am loving the experience, typing more than I ever have and being more efficient with my work!

It needs to be more clearly advertised that the switches are not hotswappable. All switches are soldered on. Which is fine if this was a great keyboard out of the box, but:2. The stabilizers on this thing are BAD. Like, very mushy and unresponsive. The spacebar sticks constantly. Unless I absolutely slam it, I have a 50/50 shot of my keystroke actually registering. The other keys using stabilizers are mushy at best (e.g. enter, backspace, shift).The spacebar is relatively important, and the end result is a very bad keyboard. I will be ordering the hotswappable version direct from keychron's site because I think this would actually be a very good keyboard with upgraded stabilizers.

"R21O5PWH3RJWTR","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021",5,"Solid Mac-first keyboard, with only a few caveats...","Since I needed new peripherals to go along with my new M1 Mac mini last November, after years of typing on flat MacBooks, I decided to finally treat myself to my first mechanical keyboard since the original IBM PC was offered with one.After a long online dive, when I surfaced I had decided on the 75% Keychron Wireless Backlit RGB with Brown switches and Aluminum Frame.For me, these Browns by Gateron are an acceptable compromise between mechanical feel and reasonable noise, just as long as you are okay with the lack any actual mechanical ""break"" when actuating. I prefer not waking up the house late at night!That being said, I do sometimes still miss a clearly felt mechanical actuation feel, but this works for me, and is still legions ahead of any membrane keyboard, or Apple's own.IThe keyboard is rather tall, but not exceptionally so.I use it with the rear feet extended for a more sloped typing angle, which helps.I ordered the matching Keychron Wooden Palm Rest in anticipation of this and it makes a big difference when I do serious typing.I also prefer the feel of the finished wood on my palms over spongy fabric covered palmrests, or the bare glass top of my desk. When just casually surfing the web or doing other non-typing-intensive tasks, I put away the palmrest since it just tends to get in the way if I have to move the keyboard around and have desk clutter.Bluetooth is rock-solid, with never a glitch or delay, ever.In fact the connection is far more reliable than with Apple's Magic Trackpad 2 that I bought at the same time.If I recall, I think I had to use a wired connection just once, to be able to boot up my brand new M1 Mac mini.This is a condition specific to only the M1 versions when using a non-Apple keyboard on a new machine.The RGB color options and patterns, though entertaining as heck at first, end up becoming more of a distraction after a while.I ended up using one preferred color pretty much all the time. Keyboard circus lights can be distracting!A note on the colors, specifically blue.Normally a color I might choose, this blue is not very bright, even when turned all the way up in the dark.I always end up using the brightest setting for all the colors, all the time, to get to a decent brightness level.Except for blue.I find it far too subtle.in my photos I use cyan/teal, which I like very much.Battery life with the RGB lighting activated is an issue, but it's addressed in the descriptions when you buy it.Expect to get a full day's use out of it, then plug it in overnight so you're ready to go in the morning.With the illumination turned off, it's much longer, maybe a few days.After nearly a year of use, I can say I am still satisfied with my purchase.I wish the lighting was a tad brighter, and the rubber on one of the folding feet has disappeared (a much bigger problem on the Keychron Palm Rest on which ALL of the pads slid right off it's base - a BIG problem since it'll wobble without!), but not enough suffer any buyers remorse.The keycaps still look good with crisp lettering, and they haven't acquired significant shine from use yet.Battery life is as purchased.it still looks and types great.Whether or not you consider it's reasonable cost vs. comparably featured keyboards from some others, it's a worthy purchase.Except for that one rubber foot-pad... When one falls off, you know more will eventually follow.Especially when you consider how awful they were on my Palmrest.I tried everything to get them to stick - unacceptable that they all fell off within a few weeks of purchase.Keychron, you make some good gear that I'm comfortable recommending to others.I want mine made right again; how does one get replacement feet, please?",true,1,7,"16","B07YB32H52","keyboard keychron k3",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,2623,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YB32H52","12065.80",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K2 Wireless Bluetooth/USB Wired Gaming Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys RGB LED Backlit N-Key Rollover Alumin...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614chmBNoqL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Been using a Kira for the past couple of years and before that, I had a crappy (but handsome) Excalibur 75% kb, this one is very nice. The only things I don't like about the keyboard is:- Lights reset whenever I switch machines or switch to Bluetooth. I have the keyboard attached to a KVM switch, whenever I switch the KVM to another machine. I'm not big on keyboard lights as I don't use shine-through keycaps. So it's pointless to have them on- Bluetooth is severely borked. It lags, types randomly by itself (usually the last key you pressed), its especially annoying when it gets stuck on backspace as it will delete everything you've typed until you hit another key.- The plastic case is plastic. I would have loved either a low-profile case or a metal one. I would have paid extra for either of those options. That being said, although it's plastic, and looks rather cheap, it's pretty solid and doesn't make weird plasticie noises when typing.If you use this keyboard with it plugged directly, it's great!

Honestly, I didn't even know they weren't in the keyboard to begin with, but only after I started using it, I found out that it wasn't there, which impacted my productivity heavily since I have them bound as shortcuts and macros for other programs. So for me, the removal of those keys was the killing catch, but to other people who may not care about the keys and only use the keyboard for gaming or everyday use that's not for productivity, then it would be a solid catch, but this keyboard just isn't for me.

Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,7,"17","B08176SM7C","logitech g 102",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split Trigger Buttons...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you?

Great if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate.","When compared to the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate , after 1 week of use:TLDR - Scroll wheel and LED upgrades are good.But... the +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. No way to adjust resistance. I really wish they had kept that feature.Some people wont like the change to the weight, but I wont mind it.With all that said, if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate, you'll be happy with this mouse.",true,1,10,"110","B09C13PZX7","logitech g 102",false,69.99,"USD",0,0,0,70,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C13PZX7","315.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Razer Basilisk V3 Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse: Fastest Gaming Mouse Switch - Chroma RGB Lighting - ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JKqNxaZkL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The Basilisk's shape isn't as comfortable for my hands as that mouse, mainly because it's lacking a little in size compared to the MX. This mouse is much nicer for gaming though as there are more DPI options, and honestly the clicks seem a little more responsive for gaming.The software control for this mouse is good, but I feel it's not as responsive as the wired Basilisk V2 that I had was. This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly. Honestly, I think V2 looks a little bit more classy because it's not leaving an RGB shadow behind by default.Still I think the V3 is overall a better upgrade over the V2 because of the infinite scroll wheel.

"R2PG62VIJT9QPW","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021",1,"Arrived broken","Mouse is a bit heavier, and the mouse buttons a bit more (aurally) clicky and (physically) bouncy than the mice I'm familiar with (that being both cheap ones and ones in a similar price range to this one). I'm actually having the impression that $5 mice have more responsive buttons, due to the delay that the ""bounce"" of the buttons causes.I believe the clicking is about on par with a mechanical keyboard in volume.The cable is fluid enough, but a bit shorter than all the other mice I've used [making it impossible to reach the top of my desk from the back USB ports, forcing me to plug it into the front], and a bit draggy if you don't give it a bit of coil by the mouse [though still less draggy than a heavy stiff cable].The mouse wheel isn't especially pleasant to use, due mostly to an uncomfortable surface design. The middle button actually felt more like a proper mouse button than the left and right ones, and seemed responsive enough.Basic assessment aside, my experience with the mouse was overall a disaster. Upon hooking it up to my PC, the mouse failed to respond properly on any surface I put it to, as well as to both rapid and carefully inched motions.Regardless of attempt, it alternated between having a sort of delayed, jolting response to motion [the cursor basically hopping across the screen in a manner usually reserved for when your system memory is locked up] and having making shorter but similarly delayed jumps that then flickered a bit around the initial stopping position. Thus, in the first case, you have to guess where it'll land and, in the second instance, you might be able to get it to land near a button only to flicker off by a cusror length immediately after.I downloaded the management software for the company's products, but clicking the executable took me to an install confirmation prompt that, when accepted, simply vanished without actually proceeding to any kind of installation. Top quality, that.Looking at the software images provided in the Amazon listing, I notice that the sensor has a bright red glow similar to all other mice I've used. For the mouse I received, I had to put my eye right up touching the mouse just to see a very faint glow deep inside the mouse. With that in mind, I'm inclined to believe my issue was less one of general mouse quality or software configuration, and more of having a faulty sensor light.Either way, even if I did simply have a defective mouse, the overall quality of the mouse simply did not impress me for its price range. As I noted at the start, nearly every component of the mouse was far lower quality than I was expecting. The only redeemable parts- the grip/surface and the middle button, were simply average in quality, not notably standing out against budget mice.In the end, this mouse had nothing to offer but massive disappointment.",true,1,11,"111","B07H3GFJJ2","logitech g 102",true,24.99,"USD",29.99,5,16.67,2973,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H3GFJJ2","13675.80",false,false,false,false,"HyperX Pulsefire Core - RGB Gaming Mouse, Software Controlled RGB Light Effects & Macro Customization, Pixart 3327 Sensor ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413jb9SWLPS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The TLDR is that it's incredibly well built, fully wireless, responsive, and the lightest mouse on the market. And it's pearly white.I don't know what other relevant details I can give. This mouse has been stress-tested by the best in the tech. industry and Logitech weren't lying, this mouse is FAST. It has incredibly low latency, very good battery life (I mean...there's zero RGB lighting), and is quite possibly the safest shape a mouse can come in. If you don't consider your hands much larger or smaller than most people, it will probably be comfortable holding this mouse.The visual design is intelligent. It has this elegance that isn't the embarrassing ""gamer"" stylings of other products but isn't so minimalistic that you wouldn't immediately recognize this mouse at first glance. Anybody who's ever used this mouse knows exactly what this feels and looks like.Is this mouse necessary? Absolutely not. I think the only thing more over-the-top than this mouse is the amount of R&D and feedback Logitech went through to create one of the best mice in PC gaming. I do prefer the Razer Viper Ultimate over this because I prefer the texture and shape. I am also bothered that a $150 computer mouse looks almost too simple. Also, in my opinion, the Viper Ultimate doesn't feel that much heavier than this. I wanted to note that, in case anybody wanted a cheaper alternative.Overall, this mouse is a flex, or for anybody who wants to go out of their way to spend time and money on their gaming hobby (gaming career maybe?). I considered buying this since it launched and was not disappointed.

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse. If you have large hands (especially in length), I highly recommend this mouse because you can claw and fingertip this mouse comfortably, and maybe even palm grip.

I knew the full set up I was looking for was going to be expensive, so I decided to stick with Logitech instead of going with thrustmaster or Fanatec. Works great and gives me the amount of feedback I was looking for. I almost bought the Logitech shifter as well, but decided to get a better one that last minute. I highly suggest you spend the extra for the shifter. I've used the Logitech one before, but it isn't as structurally strong, and I felt like a toy. The only downside I had with this steering wheel is the actual wheel size (that's why I upgraded it from the start). It's far too small and changes how you drive.

The leather on the wheel and the wheel itself feels very very nice and sturdy. The buttons are a little cheap though, but that's okay.It has some quirks that you will eventually notice though, not tooo big of a deal personally though.Eventually after regular use, the wheel may start squeaking/hissing when the wheel is turning left.You may run into the problem where the wheel becomes off center, this is usually due to you turning too hard to the left. To fix it, just turn to the right all the way lightly, then just push a little harder and then you'll feel something shift back into place.It's actually really hard to press the shifters behind the wheel if the wheel is turned, since it's locked relative to the wheel. It would be a lot easier if the shifters were attached to the wheel base instead, so they didn't move when you turn.The clamp is a little lackluster, if you turn too hard sometimes the wheel will slide a bit, if you're really going at it I've had it come off of the table. That's rare, and only if you're aggressively drifting on a car with low torque and turn radius haha. None of that applies if you get a rig for the whole setup.Overall, good for the price.

It's an easy fix to just go out and buy new skatez, but, for a new product, I should have to just yet.Other things I am not a fan of is this mouse is good for smaller hands, I feel.

Changing this review to awfulThis akali mouse pad is honestly alright. It's nothing special and definitely a little overprices. I would probably only pay $20 instead of $30 for this thing in the future. The image itself seems very cheaply printed on. It looks like 720p stretched over the entire mat. The rgb is held on with thin wiring i feel like will probably break sooner than later.Some good things though: it is a gaming pad and doesnt slide around. I have a glass desk and the pad doesn't move around so that is a plus. It's not thicker or thinner than other pads i've had so that's fine too. The micro usb hub that controls the rgb is probably the nicest thing about this pad. It's thin and out of the way and the single button control is pretty intuitive.You should get this gaming pad if you are fine with mediocre quality and cheap looking spice to add to your setup.

"R35F488ZTHZZSA","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"How do gaming mice this bad even exist?","At first this seemed like a decent gaming mouse to use until I got the Glorious Model O Wireless, (check out all Glorious mice, they're much better than this and have a similar design!) but it was flaming garbage. I play a lot of minecraft 1.8.9 which has spam clicking combat and you need pretty high cps to last with many other factors, and I butterfly click, which is putting the pads of your index and middle fingers on one mouse button and rotating them up and down one finger at a time, and on my main mouse which is a cheap lenovo office mouse i got from my teacher for free, i can get up to 17 clicks per second. Butterfly clicking relies on double clicking, and this mouse doesn't double click, which I suppose is a good thing, butI can't click fast at all on it. Since jitter clicking doesnt rely on doubleclicks, I think a good jitter clicker could get like 14 cps on this thing but i dont jitter click because it hurts my arm and you can also get early carpel tunnel. As far as I remember with my experience on this thing, my max cps was 10, VERY VERY RARELY. The sensor also had lots of delay sometimes. Whenever i spun my mouse was when I most realized it. It has bad feet which scratch against your mousepad, but decent dpi and decent rgb lights. Another bad thing is that the macro side buttons arent very sturdy, but very soft instead, and not clicky enough so you can easily press one of them without meaning to and mess yourself up in some games. Also, the LED lights don't have the exact color they have on the amazon thumbnail of this product. Also, I have a personal preference for symmetrical mice, and this one isn't symmetrical, but you can't notice that and it doesn't affect my review. I try drag clicking on this mouse sometimes, which is using friction to drag your finger on a mouse button and get over 50 cps on quality mice by good drag clickers, but this mouse only picks up 1 click. This is a very good mouse for every day use as it still looks pretty sick, but this is NOT a gaming mouse. One more thing. If it had a mouse software to adjust the debounce time and possibly get a high cps, i might consider using this mouse. But it doesn't have a software at all. I spent an hour of my life searching for one when i bought this. Please stick to a more well known brand for gaming materials such as Glorious, Razor, Redragon, or Logitech unless you want to be scammed like me. I'm getting my Glorious Model O Wireless next week, and as my friend only wants an rgb mouse I'm going to be giving this one to him. I do think the model o wireless looks cooler though. At least my efforts won't be for nothing. I don't even play other games with this mouse and never have, as I play minecraft mostly. However, I have seen some reviews on this mouse and only 1 good review by an infamous youtuber who seemed to only like this mouse for its rgb, color, and charging mechanics, as his old mouse ran on batteries, and i'm pretty sure this was before heavy use. It would be better to get a good gaming mouse from a more well-known or popular budget gaming brand. Either way, this is a horrible mouse, so do me a favor and DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS MOUSE!",true,1,8,"18","B08L23CGX8","logitech g 502 hero kda",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,1692,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L23CGX8","7106.40",false,false,false,false,"BENGOO KM-1 Wireless Gaming Mouse, Computer Mouse with Honeycomb Shell, 6 Programmed Buttons, 3 Adjustable DPI, Silent Cli...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SAa5qiaIL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,14,"114","B093LSMKL3","logitech g 502 hero kda",true,49.99,"USD",59.99,10,16.67,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093LSMKL3","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 5 Gaming Mouse with PrismSync RGB Lighting and 9 Programmable Buttons – FPS, MOBA, MMO, Battle Royale – ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QdKZP26rS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse. If you have large hands (especially in length), I highly recommend this mouse because you can claw and fingertip this mouse comfortably, and maybe even palm grip.

The G500 lasted about 2 years, which for the pricepoint, was fantastic to me compared to the 1 year lifespan of the pricier Razer mice that broke.So, I got this mouse, the G502, since the Logitech 500 lifespan forced me out of Razer. So far the G502 has treated me really well with its functionality. The mouse software, G HUB, lets you set almost any Windows shortcuts per buttons, such as having 'Copy' (Ctrl + C) on your MOUSE4, and 'Paste' on your MOUSE5. Has good functionality across apps too, like Discord, where you can mute yourself at anytime with a button click.For gaming it feels smooth, with adjustable DPI settings also at a button click (by default).

I called the Logitech G support/warranty number on their website, and was speaking to a helpful support guy within about 45 seconds. He had a list of things to try to fix the issue before proceeding with the warranty claim. One of those things was to blow air underneath the mouse buttons to clean out any dust/debris that collected there. I did this, and so far (a couple days only) it has fixed my problem.

This mouse has been stress-tested by the best in the tech. industry and Logitech weren't lying, this mouse is FAST. It has incredibly low latency, very good battery life (I mean...there's zero RGB lighting), and is quite possibly the safest shape a mouse can come in.

Anybody who's ever used this mouse knows exactly what this feels and looks like.Is this mouse necessary? Absolutely not. I think the only thing more over-the-top than this mouse is the amount of R&D and feedback Logitech went through to create one of the best mice in PC gaming.

Also, in my opinion, the Viper Ultimate doesn't feel that much heavier than this. I wanted to note that, in case anybody wanted a cheaper alternative.Overall, this mouse is a flex, or for anybody who wants to go out of their way to spend time and money on their gaming hobby (gaming career maybe?).

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse.

Ademas, encontrar un set de keycaps que cubra todas las teclas, es complicado, dado que las unidades de algunas teclas como el espacio (5.75u), el shift, y los ctrl, no son estandar o OEM.-El software, quizas puede generarle algunas complicaciones a algunos usuarios.En resumen:Pros:-Teclado premium en su mayoria, buena construccion.-Iluminacion bastante prominente.-Switches brown bastante comodos, no son tan ruidosos como los blue, de la version original de este teclado (g pro).-Diseño unico hasta el momento.Cons:-Keycaps un poco incomodas, con un desgaste un poco mas acelerado-Incompatibilidad con todas las keycaps estandares, dado el formato especial de logitech.-Switches no intercambiables.En mi puntuacion el dare un 7/10, debido a las limitantes que presentan las keycaps tanto para un cambio a futuro, como sus unidades especiales.",true,1,4,"15","B08W2TFZZC","logitech g pro",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,198,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W2TFZZC","930.60",false,false,false,false,"Logitech G PRO K/DA Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Ultra-Portable Tenkeyless Design, Detachable Micro USB Cable, 16.8 Million...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b73jZMqUL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I bought them one at a time as each one broke. About a year of pretty frequent use, one of the rotary knobs (the one most used) breaks off from each FIP. I replaced the first one with the second one, the second one with the third one. It's whichever button you rotate the most that will break. The tiny plastic connection is ridiculously small and weak. Button stubs still turn with a small screwdriver, or turn with mouse on screen. But that kind of negates the feature of having ""real knobs"" on the device.I recommend planning on replacing them in about a year if you flight sim frequently. You can use the broken ones for gauges that don't require a lot of button twisting.Download/purchase SPAD. It's an interface between lots of 3rd party gauges and this device. Go look at the free sample gauges and the paid gauges. They're only a couple dollars per gauge. If you can afford 125 bucks (x3 or more) for this piece of hardware, ten bucks for a couple of software gauges is a no brainer.Despite the broken knob thing, I'm still giving it four stars. It's just fabulous to have the gauge sitting ""over there"" instead of mousing/scrolling around on screen to see the gauge. Separate gauges like this encourage the quick look/cross check that we should be doing anytime there's gauges on a machine.I wish they'd beef up the knob to rotary controller connection.

There is clearly a bunch of room on the other side for another 6 buttons but for some reason Logetech decided to waste the space with the logo that will be rarely looked at when in use.

Hooked it up to my PC and installed the drivers automaticaly and worked intsantly. Shipping was fast as usual. Came within 24 hours as usual with Prime items.

For half the cost of what I paid long ago, it’s okay - but the internal parts cannot possibly be the same in this newer unit and the fit/finish is mediocre.(The included pictures highlight rough/sharp pieces of plastic, and seams that don’t fit together well. I would have saved my old joystick for comparison photos if I knew these wouldn’t be the same.)The yaw/twist axis is sensitive but slightly unsettled on center, forcing me to calibrate a wider dead-zone than I would prefer to cancel it out. The other axis work fine without issue though.The trigger had a sharp plastic burr I needed to sand off. The seams on the stick itself are aligned poorly and feel uncomfortable compared to the old unit, with sharp edges in spots. Also, although not a real concern, the throttle feels almost gritty (compared to the silky smooth version I was used to).Overall it’s okay if you get one at bargain price, but I’d personally pay more for a version built like they used to be.

"R3U6IINMVV5SWR","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2021",5,"Works perfect with MSFS 2020","I did not even download the Logitec drivers, but used (Payware) Spad.Next instead. Spad.Next was designed for these Logitech panels (they used to be branded Saitek before Logitech purchased that company).Spad lets you assign any command whatsoever to this panel (also the Radio Panel and the Switch Panel). You can see how versatile Spad is by watching Youtube videos by vadermike777.You can see how to use Spad.Next with Logitech panels by watching Les O'Reilly videos on Youtube. Les calls them for exapmple: (Sim Video) New User #1 | SPAD.neXtWhich is #1 in the series (getting started with Logitech panels and Spad.Next).The advantage of Spad.Next is that you can change the panel functions (what each switch and knob does, or how it does it). And you can use a different profile for each plane. It will load the right profile with the plane for you. (You cannot change any panel function with the official Logitech drivers)!Example: another panel is the Logitech Switch Panel (this one is the Multi Panel). On it is a switch labeled 'Panel Light'. Except most planes don't have a panel light (lights behind the gauges). Instead they use an overhead dome light (e.g. the default Cessna 172). With Spad.Next you tell the Logitech panel to use the rocker switch labeled 'PANEL LIGHT' to turn on and off the dome light instead of the panel light. If you are running the Logitech official plugin driver then you are out of luck. You won't be able to see the gauges at night using that switch. Because you can't reprogram the panel. But you can very easily reprogram them with Spad.Next.I have 3 Logitech panels: Switch Panel, Multi Panel, Radio Panel. They join together with thumb screws (stacked on top each other, but they have could have been joined together the same way side by side). They tilt back to make them easier to read. I have to lean my vertical stack against something because of that backward tilt (to hold them up). I use the elevation desk stand that my 32"" monitor sits on.

"R35P1I8E7T278D","Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021",4,"Great so far, but needs lubricant","So far, the joystick feels very high quality and works great. It doesn't feel plasticy or flimsy at all. The software is mostly good enough, but you're going to be googling how to make certain things work pretty often.Firstly, the joystick was nearly unusable out of the box. The metal ring that the spring pushes against was grinding and catching on the plastic ring of the base to the extent that I couldn't make any fine movements. I applied a tiny bit of chapstick (not the best, but its what I had) and the grinding decreased completely except for one spot. After a day of use, that spot has disappeared and the joystick moves as smoothly as butter. If you're having a similar issue, give it a bit of grease and play with it for a while.If you're going to install the software, you're going to have to make a few adjustments if you want to use the clutch button ( i ) and the pinkie trigger. For games like elite dangerous and war thunder, which have built in presets for this HOTAS, with the software installed, you'll need to disable clutch mode in windows and delete the pinkie trigger settings in the software. You can google how to do these; it takes about a minute to do both.While you're in the windows settings disabling clutch mode, you should also decrease the brightness of the LEDs (which you can customize to a large extent). They're excessively bright by default (as pretty much all things are), and I found just barely above zero to be pleasant.This HOTAS is definitely not without issue, and only time will tell if it lasts long, but so far I would recommend it highly.

"RHWMGNW1B74BL","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2021",5,"A good mechanical keyboard for those who want their experience to be ""one and done""","I have owned several mechanical keyboards over the past 3 years. Ranging from cheap crap like Red Dragon, to consumer stuff like Corsair and Razer, as well as some of the higher end custom boards like the TOFU60 and some KBDfans stuff.For the money, I think you can do SO much better. While I appreciate the RGB quality and the sheer amount of endless RGB customization the GHUB software allows you, that is about the only thing I can rate highly.Construction is not totally terrible for a board built primarily out of plastic. But it is very hollow sounding and does not have much substance to it when typing. Has a nice weight to it and the adjustable angle stands are nice and have been useful. Stabilizers are average, but definitely nothing special. Why are they STILL using MICRO USB? It literally would cost them less than $0.30 to use USB-C instead. I dont get it. Keycaps dont seem to be double shot PBT, but theyre decent quality nonetheless. Nice RGB shine through. Switches are proprietary Logitech Blue clicky switches. They are pretty meh. If you like the sound of a loud dry keypress with significant amount of travel and play, then youll like it. Otherwise, if youve used boards that have a more consistent and overall smooth feeling keypress, this will not be a treat to use.I think this keyboard is half decent for most folks who want something they can buy once and not have to think about again after that. But if you have very high standards, have used modded or custom or just better quality keyboards prior, this one will very likely not be a great experience.Personally, I went out on a limb because I finished building my latest PC much quicker than I anticipated and have since sold the TOFU60 I had and my backup board which was a Corsair. So I bought this on a whim wanting to give a GPRO product a try. However after a month of use, I am going to revert to building a good starter 60% or maybe TKL mechanical keyboard since that can be done for under 150 and overall can feel 10 times better than this GPRO. :lTLDR6/10.

Soft supple fake leather ear pads surround your ears, and combine that with the memory foam inserts and you have the makings of a truly comfortable fit and feel for your ears. These have 50mm drivers that provide a great sound out of the box and if you download the Logitech G HUB software, it gets even better. You can choose between some pre-defined EQ settings or you can customize and save your own.A 6’ 3.5mm headphone cable that feels sturdy and think is included. There is an inline control that you can adjust the volume and mute. I found that the placement of the control is just a bit too close to the headphones and I would have preferred it to be a few inches lower than it is.The microphone is detachable and has pretty good flexibility in it’s stalk with only the first inch of it not being able to be adjusted, but the rest of it is movable.

I had thought I would take off that side thumb rest but its actually really nice. I like the ability to adjust the scroll wheel resistance too but honestly I wouldn't pay extra for that.The docking bay is cool, its weird how easily the mouse just rests on it. When putting it back at night I had to check a couple times to make sure it was on right. It was, I'm just going to have to trust that it magically just fits in when I haphazardly put it on.The mouse is lighter than I would have expected. Not super light, but lighter than my previous generic logitech mouse and lighter than the M720. This most likely has to do with the lack of inserted batteries though.Speaking of battery life, been working with it for about four hours now and its at 88%. The lights were on. I would have put a criticism about not being able to figure out how to turn them off but I just updated and suddenly the mouse showed up in the chroma program and I was able to turn them off.The only real criticism I have is that when I press the scroll button (depressing the wheel), which I do often in a game I play to auto-run, it tends to scroll forward on click. I think its the placement of it and when I take my finger and press on it more from the front it doesn't do that so it'll be an adjustment.I haven't played with all the little setting, macros, and customizations of the lighting. I probably paid a hefty price for something that I won't use with those but as far as what a mouse is supposed to do, it does it very well.",true,1,6,"16","B07Y8SF6ZY","razer basilisk ultimate",false,147.64,"USD",0,0,0,1567,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y8SF6ZY","7208.20",false,false,false,false,"Razer Basilisk Ultimate Wireless Gaming Mouse with Charging Dock","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Rfxr8WTBL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Durch das bundle hatte ich das razer Mauspad dabei und wenn man sich 1-2 Tage an das ganze gewöhnt hat will man praktisch nichts anderes mehr. Die Maus ist sehr ergonomisch auch für Größe Hände. Man hat nahezu keine Latenz (ich merke zu meiner alten Kabelmaus 0 Unterschied)Die Docking Station ist wahnsinnig praktisch und funktioniert gut. Die Akkulaufzeit könnte ehrlich gesagt besser sein aber man kann ganicht so lange zocken wie die Maus leer wird und vollgeladen ist die auch sehr schnell. Für meinen Geschmack hat die Maus 1-2 Tasten zu wenig aber wenn man beim zocken sich schnell umgewöhnt(von mehr zu weniger Tasten) geht das auch fit.

Great if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate.","When compared to the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate , after 1 week of use:TLDR - Scroll wheel and LED upgrades are good.But... the +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone.

The Basilisk's shape isn't as comfortable for my hands as that mouse, mainly because it's lacking a little in size compared to the MX. This mouse is much nicer for gaming though as there are more DPI options, and honestly the clicks seem a little more responsive for gaming.The software control for this mouse is good, but I feel it's not as responsive as the wired Basilisk V2 that I had was. This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly. Honestly, I think V2 looks a little bit more classy because it's not leaving an RGB shadow behind by default.Still I think the V3 is overall a better upgrade over the V2 because of the infinite scroll wheel.

"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. No way to adjust resistance.

This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly. Honestly, I think V2 looks a little bit more classy because it's not leaving an RGB shadow behind by default.Still I think the V3 is overall a better upgrade over the V2 because of the infinite scroll wheel.

This leads to firing off skills or macros that I absolutely do not intend to use yet while just moving the mouse around; I've had to disable the first row of keys entirely to avoid this.Another problem the size presents is that it won't consistently hold down the LMB if I want to click and drag; it'll often let go prematurely because my fingertips apparently don't reach far enough forward to get the leverage it needs to keep the sensors in contact.Years ago, I had a Naga that had plates you could swap out to adjust the size appropriate to your needs, but they apparently don't make them anymore, and are going with a ""one (large) size fits all"" approach.

"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

This was a disappointment, because if not for that fact I would have given this a no-fault review. A less important nitpick: The single channel EL strip, vs a multi-channel zone strip like what the Firefly uses to produce the wave effect.

"R37NEA2RQ5YJM9","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2021",5,"Low profile high performance mouse surface","I bought this to replace an 8-year-old Razer Sphex skin, which was almost identical other than the size and design. The Sphex was being used on the tiny computer desk in our family room. I like having a low profile mouse pad on that desk which doesn't stick out. The Sphex did well considering how much use it got, and how my daughter liked to lift up the edges and crease them with her nails during online class until tiny pieces eventually tore up bit by bit.I like the design of these pads. The Sphex was accurately called a desktop skin, which is what it is. This new one's called 'thin mouse pad', which can be misleading. It's basically a piece of plastic that's smooth and tacky on one side (to stay in place), and textured on the other side to give good mouse performance. This new version has a cloth 'tag' that you can use to pull it up and reposition it. These are very easy to reposition, but only as long as you keep the tacky side off the table as little as possible so it doesn't collect dust, and make sure any surface you move it to is cleaned thoroughly. You also have to be careful not to crease it, since any crease on this material is permanent and will always show. For all these reasons, this is NOT appropriate as a travel mouse pad.I was initially worried that the design on this would be too bright, but the actual mousepad has more muted colors than in the pictures.

I would say if you need large amounts of room for flicking I would go for the hyperX mat, but if you have a higher sen I would recommend this one as it has a few advantages. It's thinner so when you move your arm It's not as noticeable, and because its smaller, it is easier to clean in the tub or sink, and the edge of the mat feels less intrusive as well.But comparing both surfaces of each mat, the hyperx feels slightly more stretchy but softer to the touch, and the G-SR feels a bit more rough. This in practice doesn't seem to affect my aim or comfort at all over time.You should also consider value as the G-SR is also more expensive than the hyperx even though it is more expensive.The only con so far with the G-SR is that when I play Osu or FPS games that require fast arm motions, it slips on the table about 2-3 inches from time to time.",true,1,11,"110","B00T56XWZU","razer gigantus v2",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,1772,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00T56XWZU","8328.40",false,false,false,false,"BenQ Zowie G-SR Gaming Mousepad for Esports I Cloth Surface I Stitched Edges I Large Size","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dsVEqEiYL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R28KEZH77S4MSX","Reviewed in Italy on October 14, 2021",,"Razer Sphex V2: antiscivolo e super veloce!","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. ✔️ È antiscivolo!Inizio da qui perché ero titubante sull'acquisto leggendo le altre recensioni. Il tappetino arriva con una pellicola super sottile e super trasparente applicata sul retro. Sembra che non ci sia! Per notarla e rimuoverla correttamente, bisogna guardare attentamente nel punto che ho indicato nella foto: vicino la linguetta Razer. Se non rimuoverete la pellicola che protegge lo strato antiscivolo, ovviamente il tappetino non sarà antiscivolo.Una volta rimossa, basterà pulire bene la superficie della scrivania, posare il tappetino e questo non si schioderà più (come si può vedere in video, dove scuoto la scrivania ma il tappetino non cede di 1mm!). Naturalmente è possibile sollevarlo intenzionalmente, sempre attraverso la linguetta Razer (non è adesivo!).✔️ Super veloce!A me piacciono i micro movimenti. Sono abituato da tanti anni a usare la massima sensibilità sui mouse proprio per muovere il meno possibile il polso. Per lo stesso motivo sono abituatissimo ai mini tappetini. La texture di questo tappetino è straordinaria. Sembra di poter far scorrere il mouse semplicemente soffiando.❗ Occhio ai piedini!La scorrevolezza dei tappetini duri si paga con un consumo più rapido dei piedini del mouse.Se giocate a sparatutto e, in generale, a titoli che richiedono precisione, vi serve attrito e quindi un tappetino morbido.

"R37NEA2RQ5YJM9","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2021",5,"Low profile high performance mouse surface","I bought this to replace an 8-year-old Razer Sphex skin, which was almost identical other than the size and design. The Sphex was being used on the tiny computer desk in our family room. I like having a low profile mouse pad on that desk which doesn't stick out. The Sphex did well considering how much use it got, and how my daughter liked to lift up the edges and crease them with her nails during online class until tiny pieces eventually tore up bit by bit.I like the design of these pads. The Sphex was accurately called a desktop skin, which is what it is. This new one's called 'thin mouse pad', which can be misleading. It's basically a piece of plastic that's smooth and tacky on one side (to stay in place), and textured on the other side to give good mouse performance. This new version has a cloth 'tag' that you can use to pull it up and reposition it. These are very easy to reposition, but only as long as you keep the tacky side off the table as little as possible so it doesn't collect dust, and make sure any surface you move it to is cleaned thoroughly. You also have to be careful not to crease it, since any crease on this material is permanent and will always show. For all these reasons, this is NOT appropriate as a travel mouse pad.I was initially worried that the design on this would be too bright, but the actual mousepad has more muted colors than in the pictures.

"R28KEZH77S4MSX","Reviewed in Italy on October 14, 2021",,"Razer Sphex V2: antiscivolo e super veloce!","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. ✔️ È antiscivolo!Inizio da qui perché ero titubante sull'acquisto leggendo le altre recensioni. Il tappetino arriva con una pellicola super sottile e super trasparente applicata sul retro. Sembra che non ci sia! Per notarla e rimuoverla correttamente, bisogna guardare attentamente nel punto che ho indicato nella foto: vicino la linguetta Razer. Se non rimuoverete la pellicola che protegge lo strato antiscivolo, ovviamente il tappetino non sarà antiscivolo.Una volta rimossa, basterà pulire bene la superficie della scrivania, posare il tappetino e questo non si schioderà più (come si può vedere in video, dove scuoto la scrivania ma il tappetino non cede di 1mm!). Naturalmente è possibile sollevarlo intenzionalmente, sempre attraverso la linguetta Razer (non è adesivo!).✔️ Super veloce!A me piacciono i micro movimenti. Sono abituato da tanti anni a usare la massima sensibilità sui mouse proprio per muovere il meno possibile il polso. Per lo stesso motivo sono abituatissimo ai mini tappetini. La texture di questo tappetino è straordinaria. Sembra di poter far scorrere il mouse semplicemente soffiando.❗ Occhio ai piedini!La scorrevolezza dei tappetini duri si paga con un consumo più rapido dei piedini del mouse.Se giocate a sparatutto e, in generale, a titoli che richiedono precisione, vi serve attrito e quindi un tappetino morbido.

Happily, in the 9 months of ownership I've had, I can report no warping of the mat: It's as flat as it came on the first day. (...it came rolled up, but.. you know)I like the Extended model for desk coverage. It adds a nice touch to your workspace, and has proven to be easy enough to clean with a damp cloth. The experience has been overall very good.Where it lacks is durability of the cloth skin on the mat. The right hand side (see pic) shows noticeable wear after less than a year of use. This was a disappointment, because if not for that fact I would have given this a no-fault review. A less important nitpick: The single channel EL strip, vs a multi-channel zone strip like what the Firefly uses to produce the wave effect. A mat this large would show off greatly if the EL strip could handle it, IMO.Pictures show a.) the spot on the mat where it's taken notable wear and tear, discoloring and fraying the fabric skin of the mat; and b.) a snapshot of my Goliathus workspace: From left to right: The Razer Charging Pad Chroma, the Blackwidow Chroma v2; the Mouse Dock Chroma; and the Naga Pro.

Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches. It's the most frustrating thing I've experienced with a mouse and I've finally given up and am purchasing a different one.

The Sphex was being used on the tiny computer desk in our family room. I like having a low profile mouse pad on that desk which doesn't stick out. The Sphex did well considering how much use it got, and how my daughter liked to lift up the edges and crease them with her nails during online class until tiny pieces eventually tore up bit by bit.I like the design of these pads. The Sphex was accurately called a desktop skin, which is what it is. This new one's called 'thin mouse pad', which can be misleading. It's basically a piece of plastic that's smooth and tacky on one side (to stay in place), and textured on the other side to give good mouse performance. This new version has a cloth 'tag' that you can use to pull it up and reposition it. These are very easy to reposition, but only as long as you keep the tacky side off the table as little as possible so it doesn't collect dust, and make sure any surface you move it to is cleaned thoroughly. You also have to be careful not to crease it, since any crease on this material is permanent and will always show. For all these reasons, this is NOT appropriate as a travel mouse pad.I was initially worried that the design on this would be too bright, but the actual mousepad has more muted colors than in the pictures.

Il tappetino arriva con una pellicola super sottile e super trasparente applicata sul retro. Sembra che non ci sia! Per notarla e rimuoverla correttamente, bisogna guardare attentamente nel punto che ho indicato nella foto: vicino la linguetta Razer. Se non rimuoverete la pellicola che protegge lo strato antiscivolo, ovviamente il tappetino non sarà antiscivolo.Una volta rimossa, basterà pulire bene la superficie della scrivania, posare il tappetino e questo non si schioderà più (come si può vedere in video, dove scuoto la scrivania ma il tappetino non cede di 1mm!). Naturalmente è possibile sollevarlo intenzionalmente, sempre attraverso la linguetta Razer (non è adesivo!).✔️ Super veloce!A me piacciono i micro movimenti. Sono abituato da tanti anni a usare la massima sensibilità sui mouse proprio per muovere il meno possibile il polso. Per lo stesso motivo sono abituatissimo ai mini tappetini. La texture di questo tappetino è straordinaria.

Happily, in the 9 months of ownership I've had, I can report no warping of the mat: It's as flat as it came on the first day. (...it came rolled up, but.. you know)I like the Extended model for desk coverage. It adds a nice touch to your workspace, and has proven to be easy enough to clean with a damp cloth. The experience has been overall very good.Where it lacks is durability of the cloth skin on the mat. The right hand side (see pic) shows noticeable wear after less than a year of use. This was a disappointment, because if not for that fact I would have given this a no-fault review. A less important nitpick: The single channel EL strip, vs a multi-channel zone strip like what the Firefly uses to produce the wave effect. A mat this large would show off greatly if the EL strip could handle it, IMO.Pictures show a.) the spot on the mat where it's taken notable wear and tear, discoloring and fraying the fabric skin of the mat; and b.) a snapshot of my Goliathus workspace: From left to right: The Razer Charging Pad Chroma, the Blackwidow Chroma v2; the Mouse Dock Chroma; and the Naga Pro.

I love the changeable surface texture, and I love the nice hefty base. It even comes with a case, which is hilarious. There are a few of caveats to this mouse pad:1) The big aluminum backing plate interferes with wireless. I moved my wireless receiver to the USB port on the side of my monitor so it's basically line of sight, but before that I had it in the back of my tower (where it worked with a simple plastic mouse pad) and experienced very inconsistent behavior.2) Hard plastic grabs mouse skate material - you will need to replace your skates from time to time. This also means cleaning your mouse pad regularly.3) I cannot find an OEM replacement for the plastic, and I'm already wearing smooth spots on it. I'm sure I can source a 3rd party sheet of plastic and cut a bunch out on the water jet at work, but that's not practical for most users.

"RWQ9CAALUOHXD","Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2021",5,"Better get one now. Here's why.","High-quality aluminum mats are the slickest, they glide like no other pad/mat every made. The only two (high-quality) aluminum mats ever made were this one and the Steelseries SX. BOTH are long out of production. You won't find a NIB Steelseries SX anywhere on Earth; personally I liked it more than the Manticor … but again, they are techno-history now.So here you are. This is the last of the new old stock for these Manticors. So grab one while you still can.Ok, it (and the SX) at $50, that's pretty pricey. Especially when you see $15 no-name aluminum mats all over Amazon. But if you read the reviews for all those no-names, you will see a lot of complaints – they don't last long, the finish is paint instead of anodized, they are rough-ridin' and so on. That's was never true about the SX or the Manticor. My SX only gave up the slick, taking on some chips and with a serious loss of finish, after about 14 years. And I have one Manticor that is six years old; it's taken one barely visible 3mm water stain and still rides 110% slick. So, on a cost-per-year basis, you come out sweet on the Manticor.So again, if you want the quickest, slickest ride for your mouse, better get one of (the last of) these while you can.Disclaimer: To get all the slick & quick I can, I also put strips ofCS Hyde Teflon Mouse Tape (click here)over my mice feet … and I also spritz & wipe the Manticor with a bit ofDuPont Silicone Teflon Lubricant Aerosol Spray (click here).",true,1,23,"122","B00B829UQY","razer sphex v2",false,49.99,"USD",0,0,0,157,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B829UQY","690.80",false,false,false,false,"Razer Manticor: Optimized Tracking Surface - Aircraft Grade Aluminum Material - Microscopic Texture - Gaming Mouse Pad","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31PyfNwRz1L._AC_UL320_.jpg"

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great!

They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands.

"R1JJ19I3ODVT9J","Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2021",3,"Its weight is the only stand-out feature.","The mouse 1 and 2 touch when fully depressed simultaneously. Scroll wheel isn't the most comfortable, but there's nothing wrong with it. Side buttons are very thin. Stock feet are basic black teflon. Those are the shortcomings of this mouse. I personally got used to the scroll wheel and side buttons quickly and aimed confidently with this mouse. The side buttons have good clicks and decent travel. So their ridiculously thin shape alone really doesn't make them unusable. Cable is a decent paracord. Aftermarket ones are better, but this one's fine. Replaced the feet before I even used it. It uses G203/G305 skates without the sensor ring, which makes it easy to find skates. The main reason you should get it is the weight. Under 45g stock is NUTS. This combined with the narrow egg shape makes for an extremely nimble mouse. This is a mouse you get strictly for fingertip grip in shooter games. There's really no other reason to get it considering its shortcomings. I've owned like 15 or so gaming mice and would not get this for anything else. Not general use. Not other types of games.

Just replace the feet and you'regood to go because the feet are from g203 and it's not that good. you can get ceramic ones from here. also you can replace the Paracord without having to take out the pcb. the switches are great if you want to adjust tension there are two screws inside the top shell. scroll wheel is just very basic. dpi button is very stiff like I said just adjust those tension screws inside. another mod you can do is 3d print a even smaller shell and take the sensor and the cord from this mouse. also painting it is very easy everything comes apart nicely! this is an all around a good mouse for claw style or fingertips style. side buttons are average as well. they're platic soldered on if you want to paint them they'd come apart if you press a little hard enough. And they're still nicely held back on the shell even if you do that. overall I'd say a good mouse coming from a glorious o- user. oh and the software doesn't do polling rate just basic things you can download that from their webpage it's bare bones stuff. if you can code I'm sure you can come up with something to adjust that based on either this or the Cox cm600 software.",true,1,10,"110","B08RC52N5R","razer viper 8khz",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,25,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RC52N5R","102.50",false,false,false,false,"Teamwolf Ultra Lightweight 45g only Optical Pro Gaming Mouse Speedflex Cable 16000 DPI Optical Sensor Lurker Mk-01","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IlL-1Eg5L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches.

I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times. Clickers work well andthe wheel was surprisingly better than I feared - not exactly smoot, not horribly bumpy.Overall, I like this mouse and for the money, feel like I got a good product for the cost.

This mouse has been stress-tested by the best in the tech. industry and Logitech weren't lying, this mouse is FAST.

It has this elegance that isn't the embarrassing ""gamer"" stylings of other products but isn't so minimalistic that you wouldn't immediately recognize this mouse at first glance. Anybody who's ever used this mouse knows exactly what this feels and looks like.Is this mouse necessary? Absolutely not. I think the only thing more over-the-top than this mouse is the amount of R&D and feedback Logitech went through to create one of the best mice in PC gaming. I do prefer the Razer Viper Ultimate over this because I prefer the texture and shape. I am also bothered that a $150 computer mouse looks almost too simple. Also, in my opinion, the Viper Ultimate doesn't feel that much heavier than this. I wanted to note that, in case anybody wanted a cheaper alternative.Overall, this mouse is a flex, or for anybody who wants to go out of their way to spend time and money on their gaming hobby (gaming career maybe?).

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse.

I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone.

The Basilisk's shape isn't as comfortable for my hands as that mouse, mainly because it's lacking a little in size compared to the MX. This mouse is much nicer for gaming though as there are more DPI options, and honestly the clicks seem a little more responsive for gaming.The software control for this mouse is good, but I feel it's not as responsive as the wired Basilisk V2 that I had was. This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly.

Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,13,"113","B08176SM7C","razer viper mini",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split Trigger Buttons...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

It's an easy fix to just go out and buy new skatez, but, for a new product, I should have to just yet.Other things I am not a fan of is this mouse is good for smaller hands, I feel.

"R37NEA2RQ5YJM9","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2021",5,"Low profile high performance mouse surface","I bought this to replace an 8-year-old Razer Sphex skin, which was almost identical other than the size and design. The Sphex was being used on the tiny computer desk in our family room. I like having a low profile mouse pad on that desk which doesn't stick out. The Sphex did well considering how much use it got, and how my daughter liked to lift up the edges and crease them with her nails during online class until tiny pieces eventually tore up bit by bit.I like the design of these pads. The Sphex was accurately called a desktop skin, which is what it is. This new one's called 'thin mouse pad', which can be misleading. It's basically a piece of plastic that's smooth and tacky on one side (to stay in place), and textured on the other side to give good mouse performance. This new version has a cloth 'tag' that you can use to pull it up and reposition it. These are very easy to reposition, but only as long as you keep the tacky side off the table as little as possible so it doesn't collect dust, and make sure any surface you move it to is cleaned thoroughly. You also have to be careful not to crease it, since any crease on this material is permanent and will always show. For all these reasons, this is NOT appropriate as a travel mouse pad.I was initially worried that the design on this would be too bright, but the actual mousepad has more muted colors than in the pictures.

Great if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate.","When compared to the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate , after 1 week of use:TLDR - Scroll wheel and LED upgrades are good.But... the +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. No way to adjust resistance. I really wish they had kept that feature.Some people wont like the change to the weight, but I wont mind it.With all that said, if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate, you'll be happy with this mouse.",true,1,12,"112","B09C13PZX7","razer viper ultimate wireless",false,69.99,"USD",0,0,0,70,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C13PZX7","315.00",false,false,false,false,"Razer Basilisk V3 Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse: Fastest Gaming Mouse Switch - Chroma RGB Lighting - 26K DPI Optical...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JKqNxaZkL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The Basilisk's shape isn't as comfortable for my hands as that mouse, mainly because it's lacking a little in size compared to the MX. This mouse is much nicer for gaming though as there are more DPI options, and honestly the clicks seem a little more responsive for gaming.The software control for this mouse is good, but I feel it's not as responsive as the wired Basilisk V2 that I had was. This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly. Honestly, I think V2 looks a little bit more classy because it's not leaving an RGB shadow behind by default.Still I think the V3 is overall a better upgrade over the V2 because of the infinite scroll wheel.

"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

This mouse has been stress-tested by the best in the tech. industry and Logitech weren't lying, this mouse is FAST. It has incredibly low latency, very good battery life (I mean...there's zero RGB lighting), and is quite possibly the safest shape a mouse can come in. If you don't consider your hands much larger or smaller than most people, it will probably be comfortable holding this mouse.The visual design is intelligent. It has this elegance that isn't the embarrassing ""gamer"" stylings of other products but isn't so minimalistic that you wouldn't immediately recognize this mouse at first glance. Anybody who's ever used this mouse knows exactly what this feels and looks like.Is this mouse necessary? Absolutely not. I think the only thing more over-the-top than this mouse is the amount of R&D and feedback Logitech went through to create one of the best mice in PC gaming. I do prefer the Razer Viper Ultimate over this because I prefer the texture and shape. I am also bothered that a $150 computer mouse looks almost too simple. Also, in my opinion, the Viper Ultimate doesn't feel that much heavier than this. I wanted to note that, in case anybody wanted a cheaper alternative.Overall, this mouse is a flex, or for anybody who wants to go out of their way to spend time and money on their gaming hobby (gaming career maybe?).

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse.

Their service is better than Amazon, so please buy the product without any worries of amazon potentially failing you.Review of the mouse itself:The mouse hits all the important points that modern mice these days need. It is lightweight yet still has a sturdy build, excellent feeling clicks, and a coating that is easy on the hands. The shape is the old school intellimouse shape, with slight adjustments to make it even more comfortable for smaller/medium size hands.My only gripe about the mouse is the sensor - a PAW3335 which is known to have issues - but the implementation was great on this mouse. Ninjutso are aware of this, and plan an updated version so keep a look out for that one as well.Overall, I highly recommend the product not just for the quality itself, but also the friendly nature of the company as well.",true,1,12,"112","B098YZWDHY","razer viper ultimate",true,79.99,"USD",89.99,10,11.11,9,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098YZWDHY","37.80",false,false,false,false,"Ninjutso Origin One X – 65G Ultra Lightweight Wireless Gaming Mouse with USB-C Charging, 48H Battery, Kailh GM8.0 Switch &...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41YaHhSiFAL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches.

"R16ZMAILD6HEOI","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2021",4,"Side-grade to the V2. Great if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate.","When compared to the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate , after 1 week of use:TLDR - Scroll wheel and LED upgrades are good.But... the +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. No way to adjust resistance. I really wish they had kept that feature.Some people wont like the change to the weight, but I wont mind it.With all that said, if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate, you'll be happy with this mouse.",true,1,15,"115","B09C13PZX7","razer viper ultimate",false,69.99,"USD",0,0,0,70,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C13PZX7","315.00",false,false,false,false,"Razer Basilisk V3 Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse: Fastest Gaming Mouse Switch - Chroma RGB Lighting - 26K DPI Optical...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JKqNxaZkL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The Basilisk's shape isn't as comfortable for my hands as that mouse, mainly because it's lacking a little in size compared to the MX. This mouse is much nicer for gaming though as there are more DPI options, and honestly the clicks seem a little more responsive for gaming.The software control for this mouse is good, but I feel it's not as responsive as the wired Basilisk V2 that I had was. This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly. Honestly, I think V2 looks a little bit more classy because it's not leaving an RGB shadow behind by default.Still I think the V3 is overall a better upgrade over the V2 because of the infinite scroll wheel.
