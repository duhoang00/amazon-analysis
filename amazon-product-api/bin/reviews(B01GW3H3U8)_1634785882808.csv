Looks amazing.","No other better choice as an extra matching controller for the xbox one s or x. Works as expected and looks amazing. For an official controller to use AA batteries makes it even better since it will outlast the ones with built-in batteries when the spare parts start to become scarce. Packaged perfectly, works as expected, all good.",true

It was gorgeous out of the box; in terms of physical appearance, it's an easy five-star rating. However, that was until I hooked it up to my console and encountered a broken left thumbstick. All other inputs are fine, but the moment I move it into the up or down position, it repeats the input indefinitely until I jank it around a bit. This renders most games unplayable.I've been online for a couple hours, and the consensus is that I either replace the stick or replace the controller. If I could afford to buy a new controller, I wouldn't have had to buy a used one. Moreover, being in college, I don't have the spare time to tinker with a gamepad.Now I'm just angry and stuck without playing Xbox until I can save up for a proper controller. This is some really pathetic quality control by the seller. Incredibly disappointed.",true

Normally this wouldn't matter, but I have a custom faceplate I was going to put on it, but since it is the new version, and not the older version (as advertised and pictured for sale) the middle button prevents me from using the faceplate. Please note that the purple faceplate did NOT come with this order, it was separate.I have included pictures to show the controller shipped, the purple faceplate (NOT included), to show why it would not work. I also included a screenshot of what was advertised on amazon. The advertised pictures showed the older version of the controller, so I was willing to pay the $85. but instead I got shipped the exact same controller that I could pick up at walmart for $60. I will be returning it because it is overpriced and not the correct version of the controller I was hoping for. a fun bonus was it came with an extra USB-C cable, but I haven't bothered testing either the controller or the cable to see if it will work since I will not be keeping them.TL;DR: The controller shipped is a different version than advertised. However, it is in perfect condition and came with a free USB-C cable. I will be returning it since it is not compatible with older controller custom plates (NOT included) due to the additional middle button. It is $25 cheaper at Walmart for the exact same new controller.",true
