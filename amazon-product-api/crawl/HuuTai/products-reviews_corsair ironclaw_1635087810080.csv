"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,1,"10","B07QX9C9WH","corsair ironclaw",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

It's an easy fix to just go out and buy new skatez, but, for a new product, I should have to just yet.Other things I am not a fan of is this mouse is good for smaller hands, I feel.

Indicator lights work well and it has enough buttons to do normal FPS gaming and surfing options.The con, and this is unfortunately a fairly large one, I get a hair of lag when its wireless, meaning wireless mode is not ideal for FPS gaming, or really any gaming. So I frequently operate it wirelessly when I'm just surfing the net and stuff but if I'm going to play I plug it in.This might be my setup creating an issue, my tower does sit 4 feet from the mouse, the drawers for the desk are between the mouse and its receiver so these are all things that could be the cause and that I'll try and tweak down the road but it is something I am experiencing so figured fair warning to anyone else who may have a similar set up.",true,1,6,"15","B082LVNHW9","corsair ironclaw",true,69.99,"USD",79.99,10,12.5,2338,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LVNHW9","10754.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro, Wireless FPS/MOBA Gaming Mouse with SLIPSTREAM Technology, Black, Backlit RGB LED, 18000 DPI, O...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Q8UQrNpxL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The thumb rest keeps your hand on the mouse and off the pad to make for smooth movement and less drag and the ability to change the weight is more valuable than I first assumed.I picked this up on sale and I think the price point is very fair for what you are getting.

"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

"R36OOOSV99KWVV","Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2021",4,"Good mouse, no doubt about it, but beware if you have larger hands","First of all I'll preface by saying that I'm unsure if the issue of my assigned keybinds resetting was an issue of ICUE software or if it's an issue with Windows 11. Either way, it's something to be noted that there's the possibility of your ICUE software resetting or scrambling your assigned keybinds when you reboot your PC. This issue won't affect the score I gave it since I can't pinpoint the exact cause of it.What will affect it however, is it's size. For a gaming mouse, the form factor is surprisingly small. I wear a medium/large size glove and this mouse was exceptionally uncomfortable if you're using it for it's defining feature: the programmable buttons on the left. In my natural mouse grip, my thumb rests on the frontmost row of buttons, making 123/456 the easiest to access. The 789 row just behind it is a bit uncomfortable to reach. The 10/11/12 row is very difficult without shifting my hand back on the mouse or curling my thumb too far inward, which is unnatural for me personally and made using the mouse significantly more difficult than I had previously expected. And yes, this is with the number buttons slid as far to the front as I could with the adjustment screw.Additionally, the buttons themselves are very small and feature very little textural difference to help distinguish them besides some very light texturing on alternating rows. Pressing multiple buttons or pressing the wrong button is very common, more common than I would like. Between the buttons being small, being hard to distinguish one from the other, and having larger hands make utilizing the full potential of this mouse extremely difficult.Finally, the left and right clickers are very light. The weight of my middle finger alone is enough to cause the right clicker to go off.My verdict is that the mouse is potentially very good, especially if your hands are on the smaller side. Gamers with larger hands might find this mouse uncomfortable to use if you prefer to choke up on the mouse like I do. I wouldn't *not* recommend it, but I would definitely keep the size of the mouse itself and the buttons in mind when making the recommendation.",true,1,13,"112","B082LRMY53","corsair ironclaw",true,69.99,"USD",79.99,10,12.5,1867,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082LRMY53","8214.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair Scimitar RGB Elite, MOBA/MMO Gaming Mouse, Black, Backlit RGB LED, 18000 DPI, Optical","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614J0VriTRL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

However it has been a year and a half since I purchased this mouse and I am having multiple hardware issues. The scroll wheel when scrolling down will some times just start scrolling up and vice versa when scrolling down. This wasn't horrible and I could work around this. However, less than 3 days later the left mouse button started failing to work. I have to now click the left mouse button 3 to 4 times to get it to register much like my Razer started doing before I purchased this mouse. If i blow under the left mouse button it starts working again for a few minutes but once the static charge builds back up, it starts failing again.

With all the not so good reviews, especially about the screen, I hesitated for a long time before to buy it but when I got some money as a gift from a aunt I decided to try it.First of all, the device looks very good quality and it sticks very well to my K95. The buttons and widgets are easy to setup with iCUE and you can configure them as you like (color, size, background image, etc.). You can only set 6 buttons per screen but you can set as many screens as you want and it's easy to switch between them by swiping with your finger. I switched from a two monitors setup to a single 32"" one a year ago and I was missing very much to be able to monitor my temperatures while gaming without having to run some overlay programs. Turns out that thing does it wonderfully well.Unlike some other people said I didn't notice any increase of CPU usage after I connected it (but maybe it's because my Ryzen 5900x just doesn't feel it).About the screen, it's true that if you look at it from an angle you don't see anything anymore but... this thing is not supposed to be looked at from a 45 degree angle. It is supposed to be watched when you are in front of your keyboard and when you do that it's amazingly clear and bright. My only negative point is that the touch functionality when you press a button is not always super reactive but I realize that it works fine if you aim more toward the bottom of the screen instead of the top. In that way it works just fine.Overall, it's an expansive device but for me it worth it.
