"R3FC9M96NF0FDD","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021",5,"Working well","Mice are like shoes, so it's difficult to say what works well for everyone. I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times. Clickers work well andthe wheel was surprisingly better than I feared - not exactly smoot, not horribly bumpy.Overall, I like this mouse and for the money, feel like I got a good product for the cost. I generally go through mice every 1 to 3 years, depending on how they hold up.

The Bluetooth seems to work well with Macs. If you are planning on gaming with them then go pick up a cheaper pair of something because you cannot have nice audio (speakers) & voice-chat (headset) at the same time due to the way the codecs are setup for Bluetooth. Also Windows Bluetooth (tried multiple adapters and built-in BT) will randomly drop the connection. I just wanted a nice headset that just worked, and what I got was a nice headset that sometimes turns itself off, and having to choose between chatting with friends OR hearing my game.

I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times. Clickers work well andthe wheel was surprisingly better than I feared - not exactly smoot, not horribly bumpy.Overall, I like this mouse and for the money, feel like I got a good product for the cost.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,10,"19","B08176SM7C","steelseries prime",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split Trigger Buttons...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you?

Songs will have less impact, audio from movies, TV shows feels flat. Then we have the actual application the Steel Series engine 3. My god what a mess... Anytime a headset needs an additional program feels like an incomplete product.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,16,"115","B093LSMKL3","steelseries prime",true,49.99,"USD",59.99,10,16.67,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093LSMKL3","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries Rival 5 Gaming Mouse with PrismSync RGB Lighting and 9 Programmable Buttons – FPS, MOBA, MMO, B...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QdKZP26rS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control. Despite this, people seem happy with the mouse, so buy it with free returns only just in case.",true,1,16,"115","B093LSMKL3","steelseries prime",true,49.99,"USD",59.99,10,16.67,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093LSMKL3","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries Rival 5 Gaming Mouse with PrismSync RGB Lighting and 9 Programmable Buttons – FPS, MOBA, MMO, B...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QdKZP26rS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I use the Xbox elite controller, and have never had this issue until using this headset.I think it has something to do with the proprietary adapter that they use.Without the adapter, the controller never has the issue and the headset works fine..Recently, I was using my headset and it suddenly stopped working with the Xbox chat.I checked the cords, reset the receiver and did several other resets to it as well.Finally after setting the receiver back to factory defaults, I was able to get it working again.The product support on their website is very slow as well.They only email you, and it takes about 24 hours to hear back from them for each reply.That being said, they did offer to send me a new cord for my headset.. though I'd imagine that was not the cause of my issue..Overall, I've probably dumped at least 200-300 hours into this headset, the multiple batteries are very nice and the sound is great.Aside from the occasional bugs, it's not a bad headset.",true,1,19,"118","B00Z6OKIAC","steelseries prime",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,146,3.8,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00Z6OKIAC","554.80",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Siberia X800 Wireless Gaming Headset with Dolby 7.1 Surround Sound for Xbox One, Xbox 360","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/9144KkSa62L._AC_UY218_.jpg"
