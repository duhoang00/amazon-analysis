The Corsair VOID RGB Elite Wireless Gaming Headset is great in my option.

However, the upside what I like about this product is the wireless. What I like about the wireless headset is that I can get around my house with my wireless headset on, and it still works!

I've been using only this headset with my PC without using the speakers. I have to say that this is probably the best headset I've used.

The noise cancellation is excellent.. as long as you have audio playing through the headset (which is where the noise cancelling will work most of the time). In fact, its so good that people actually have to yell at me in order for me to hear them, and even then I can't make out what they're saying unless I take the headset off.While the iCue software does make the headset do a lot more, you don't actually need it.

Die klangen alle dünn und ""blechern"", das Void hat auch einen guten Anteil an unteren Mitten die mich wie ein Mensch klingen lassen und das ohne merkbares Delayin Discord, TS oder Zoom.Die Hardware Mute-taste auf der Seite finde ich viel besser als Hochklappen zum Muten.Fazit: Super Headset ich bin entsetzt dass ich für diesen Preis eine besser Performance als bei den 300€ Headsets bekomme.

"R2UOTYDJWTAWF3","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",5,"Excellent headset and versatility, but subpar software","I want to preface this by saying I've had this headset for a year and a half and has held up well through the somewhat torture I've given it! Keep in mind I use this headset anywhere from 10-25 hours a week so if that gives you any idea as to how much I've used these, do with that as you will. Anyways here's a pros and cons list to simplify it with a summary to recap my thoughts on this headset.Pros:-The versatility of these headphones is great mainly because you can plug them into your pc or console, charge them and keep playing or just use them while plugged in, AND connect them to your phone with an aux cord if you wanna walk around with them and blast music.-The sound quality is phenomenal with highs being crisp and lows being bassy and the mids filling the gaps to make a smoothsound or listening to music a joy. The sound isolation is great as you can hear the footsteps of someone below, above, behind. It makes a very immersive experience as it can turn a roar from a zombie around the corner go from ""ehh"", to ""holy hell what was that, and where did it come from"" experience. Not always obviously, but I've never gotten an experience like this from any other headset.-They look great, and have held up well even though I can be a bit rough with them from time to time.-When Icue works the customization for the EQ is impressive and enhances the experience if done right. Though careful, with a custom EQ, because if you push it too high or low you could have distortion issues. Something to be aware of as I feel this is more of a software issue rather than the headsets ability to produce the desired sound you want.-Mic quality is superb wireless and connected. I've never had anyone have problems with my mic quality being poor or choppy. Only time there's issues with this is either some software, program, or internet issues and not the mic itself.Cons:-Not a surprise but the cost is up there, but honestly I've gotten my money's worth and they keep going strong after a year and a half so it's a con, but small at this point.-The ear cups are not made to last. I did have to replace the ear cups after about 6 months of regular use, and it wasn't the most comfortable tbh, but I found bigger/better replacement Earcups from a 3rd party that were more much comfortable and have held up better (I have a big head and ears so this was a great find) at the cost of loss to noise canceling it is ""supposed"" to have.-Battery life on these are pretty good, but not 20 hours as they advertise. Even when they were brand new I was getting MAYBE 14-16 hours if conditions were perfect, but not 20. This being said the LI-Ion battery still gets me a solid 10 hours on a full charge and the recharge is quick so I can just throw the cable on to charge while staying in ""wireless"" mode and then 30min have passed and it's back to green again so it's a con for not completely accurate advertising, but not terrible battery life by any stretch. Just unrealistic.Cons unrelated to the headset itself, but corsairs software issues:-RGB... Idk WHY, when you turn on the headset, the mic goes RGB and shows the rainbow, but then you can not customize the mic color at all. WHY show that off and then not come through. Solid miss there.-until recently I HATED ICue but I had no choice but to use it for my headset, but with some recent updates it's gotten better. Less buggy and more dependable, but when my headset acts up I usually look at ICue first to make sure it isn't the, poor excuse for, software causing the issue.-ICue is just a very subpar app and honestly needs some major work. Idk why it's as buggy as it is because this headset deserved better than this. I won't drag the rating down because of something the app does wrong where as the headset itself is pretty dang great.-I'm lumping this in the software issue seeing as it's controlled through Icue is the 7.1 surround sound is not phenomenal. It's pretty good in some games that have surround sound features enabled, but for movies, shows, music ect. It's not great as it sometimes cuts out the mids HARD to the point where sometimes an explosion sounds muffled or just wonky for a lack of a better term. Also the higher frequencies tend to get swollowed up during bassier sequences in whatever it is so it leaves it feeling hollow in many scenes. My advice is stick with the stereo setting as it does a pretty great job of sounding equal and correct in any setting rather than hit or miss with everything. Nifty idea that fell flat imo.-voice prompts... Just... Don't use that setting...Finally the...Summary:Overall I maybe leaving a few things out, but most of the cons on the headset itself are little or not a deal breaker (atleast for me), but things to think on how to improve the virtuoso descendants going forward. I personally love the headset itself and there's more I could say, but at this point you'll have based most of your decision on what I said earlier if you even made it this far lol. My biggest gripes are the ICue software we're forced to deal with as it maybe ""esthetically"" pleasing to look at. It's a far cry from great, or even good. As it stands now it works mostly, but the bugs drive me insane. The lack of thought to letting people mess with the mics light colors is what lends me to believe it's lazy or just cheap to not let people do what they want which is just rediculous to me. I digress from this bit of rage here. In all a great headset itself, but poor software to harness all of the greatness.Headset - 9/10 few fixes/adjustments and it would probably be perfectSoftware (Icue) - was 3 - now after many updates later 6/10. If they could focus on a great customer experience and fix the bugs rather than just cheap implementation of features or lack there of for that matter, and some which haven't changed.

Esdecir solamente podemos tener una duración óptima de la batería cuando lo usamos con luces apagadas, y eso solo pasa en windows.Si no fuera por la duración de la batería, debe ser el auricular inalámbrico más perfecto que hay, para video llamadas en el trabajo, juegos en red, juegos offline, playstation (xbox, solo con cable), y con un microfono que con una precisión asombrosa.

Compressed but clear microphone, great sound, comfy and strong construction... its everything I wanted at a decent price point... even if I look like Princess Leia while wearing it.My main issue is with the usb dongle. As the description says, this is a wireless headset that uses a proprietary usb to connect to your computer. Better models have a 3.5mm option, but this one does not. A usb to micro usb is including, but it only works for charging. It does not allow the headset to be used wired (or at least that is my understanding from an hour of googling).I've had the product for around 4 months, so I am past the 90 day warranty. However, as can be seen in the photo, my usb dongle has broken with the circuit board exposed. I can still plug it in, but none of my computers can recognize it. I don't know what caused it; I didn't step on it or anything but noticed that the seam on the dongle started to separate around last week. When I plugged it in last week to my laptop, it says it wasn't recognized. I pulled it out and the plastic snapped revealing the circuit board.I tried to find a replacement, but I was directed to the Razer store where they are currently out of stock. I understand the logistical issues of our world right now, but it sucks that I can't use it because of a single missing part. I'm on a waiting list but who knows when it will come in.

"R12ZP43LF7BB99","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021",4,"Good, But Could Be Better","I upgraded to this from the Corsair HS35 because I wanted a wireless headset so that I wouldn't have to remove the headset and miss out on stuff every time I had to step away.The order arrived completely intact and without incident the day after I placed my order.I tested it out immediately, and I have been using it consistently for about a week now.It definitely serves its intended purpose (to give me a wireless option).The range on it is pretty good.I am able to walk all around the ground floor of my house and even walk outside my front door to pickup deliveries and still maintain connection.However, sometimes the connection is spotty, regardless of how far away I am from my computer, including sometimes if I am sitting right in front of it.I notice that sometimes, as I am walking away from the computer, if I move to fast, it takes time for it to catch up, so it's kind of in-and-out.But whenever I have such connection issues, usually if I power it down, remove the dongle from the USB port, re-insert it, and turn the headphones back on, the connection issues disappear.Some other things that I dislike about this:1.Size:it is adjustable, but even at its smallest, it is still a little loose on my head (for reference, my hat size is 7 1/2, although that doesn't exactly translate to a headset).While the HS35 fits perfectly, because these are a little loose, the band doesn't sit on top of my head, so my ears are really the only thing supporting it, and pretty often I can feel it slipping down on my ears, so I have to adjust it.2.When I did some testing, the recordings I did with this mic were not as clear and crisp as the ones I did with the HS35 mic.The speakers, however, seem to be pretty comparable.Other than the freedom of a wireless headset, one thing that I did like about this is that it comes with it's own windscreen, which is pretty important to me because there is a lot of background noise in the room where I use it.The windscreen does a good job filtering out the background noise.And because it comes with one, it is a perfect fit.The HS35 did not come with one, so I had to by some separately (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EJ0N5FS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which do not fit perfectly, and fall off frequently.Overall, I am pleased with Corsair HS70.For the price, you will not find a better wireless headset.Overall, I like the HS35 better, but the freedom that the wireless HS70 provides is definitely enough to make it my primary headset for the time being.I am giving it 4 stars, but it's probably more like a 3.5.I went back and forth between 3 and 4, but in the end, I felt 3 was a little too harsh.So, yes.Four stars, but really more like a 3.5.",true,1,14,"114","B07X9W721J","corsair void",true,79.99,"USD",99.99,20,20,3479,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9W721J","14959.70",false,false,false,false,"Corsair HS70 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset - 7.1 Surround Sound Headphones for PC, MacOS, PS5, PS4 - Discord Certified - 50m...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XjjJovijL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

As shown in the pictures, they use a plastic cover piece to secure the headphones and hold them in place with metal screws going into plastic parts. As you adjust the headphones to your head (my wife & son share these) you are constantly re-adjusting to a comfortable fit. This is the problem. I just had my second pair fail, due to the same issue. Only this time around we were ""on guard"", to be extremely careful when adjusting. They failed on me today as I was on a TEAMS Chat conference call. The headset works fantastic. The features are great. Adjustable sound, mute, removable boom mike. All great and work fantastically. BUT, one of the most important components in the build is made from very thin, cheap, plastic.

"R2NJCXPJ9V2VB3","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",3,"Average sound quality, quiet mic, not that comfortable","I bought into all the YouTube reviews hyping this headset. Bought a pair to see for myself and they didn’t meet expectations. Maybe it was due to all the reviews. The material and aesthetics are good and feel premium, but there were too many downsides for me to keep them.Out of the box sound quality is pretty average at best, with weak bass. Note, I never messed with the EQ settings so it's possible this can be fixed with some tweaking. Games might sound fine and if you don’t care about really good sound quality for anything else.Mic quality is actually really solid, but unfortunately really quiet. I’m sure you can increase it with some software, but Corsair should really fix that on their end. The red LED when the mic is in the mute position can get pretty distracting if on a video conference as there is no way to turn it off.For me, it wasn't super comfortable, although you can probably still wear them for long sessions without issues. I have a medium to large head and the strap is enough for me. It feels a bit too heavy and the clamping force is on the strong side.The on/off button has some issues. At times, it seems like the button doesn't register and you have to press and hold a couple of times on the right position. I even got a replacement thinking it was just that headset, but it had the same issue. I could have lived with it, if not for all the other issues.If you really just need a wireless headset with a good mic and are fine with everything else, this could work for you.

"R4K5DDTJXA51Z","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",4,"Very impressive!","If I’m being honest, the reviews almost had me running the other direction. I decided to take a leap and give them a shot anyway, and I’m glad I did! I’m a bit of an audiophile and usually rely on a dedicated amp/usb mic/audiophile cans for my gaming needs, but I wanted something wireless that I could also use on my ps5. I’ve tried many other headsets some of which included Jbl Quantum 800s, Steelseries Arctis 7ps, Audeze Penrose, and Beoplay Portals. Although, all of those are good headsets in their own right, something about them that caused me to lose interest and ultimately either return or even sell them for a loss. Generally it was either comfort, connection issues, low volume on console, or poor quality mic that was the leading culprit.Now the HS80s at $150 do everything right while managing to do nothing offensively wrong. They aren’t perfect by any means but what they manage to do at that price point is sound fantastic, have a stable connection, are extremely comfortable, and have the best wireless mic I have ever used. They also work seamlessly on PS5 and get so loud that no person using them would need to go higher than 60%.The only fault I can give these are due to software alone. For people that have used ICUE you already know the issues, but for people that haven’t, it can be particular and require some finesse to get everything working right. One issue I have is every time I turn them on they default to 8 channel audio regardless of them being set to stereo in ICUE. It’s not a huge deal you just go into your sound settings on windows and change it to 2 channel 24 bit 48khz and they sound amazing after that.

The sound is a little richer and cleaner than what I get from my Arctis 7s.The cloth earcups do mean you miss a bit of the bass, but I didn't find the experience lacking since the mids were stronger and helped fill the gap.This headset doesn't offer any 3d audio or surround sound simulations.The microphone was probably the best and worst thing about this headset at the same time.For a wireless headset, the quality of this microphone is ASTOUNDING.I've used a Blue Yeti and AT2020USB as desk microphones in the past and on a purely quality review, this microphone is right there with them for anything but the purest audiophile.Where the microphone suffers is the volume.I'm unsure if my model was defective (due to other concerns below I didn't choose to replace to see and instead did a refund), but even with every mic setting I could find in Windows and the Corsair software maxed out, my friend had to set me to 200% in discord compared to my Arctis 1s or 7s at a normal 100%.If you plan to also use this as a work headset as well, the volume might not be great for zoom or teams calls.I did not test to see how much this microphone could be boosted in OBS capture for streaming.The fit of the headband support is great and the inside adjustments are good if slightly limited, but the earcups were a bit too narrow for me.The memory foam compresses nicely, but when work there was a mild constant pressure against the back of my ears.For normal sitting and gaming it was fine, but since it is wireless, getting up and walking around made it was noticeable for any tiny movements of the headset.Apart from the ears, the overall clamp and fit was perfect though - my Arctis 7 which uses a similar elastic strap system was always too loose for my head and slipped around heavily when walking or bending, but this never seemed at risk of sliding off.",true,1,15,"115","B09BBPTDWX","corsair void",false,149.99,"USD",0,0,0,34,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BBPTDWX","136.00",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR HS80 RGB Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with Spatial Audio - Works with Mac, PC, PS5, PS4 - Carbon","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SzBbPQQeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R1QPVR50VTMGS6","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2021",5,"Best overall headsets","Don’t usually write reviews. First use of these I was blown away. So far only played a game with them, they are extremely comfortable. Looking forward to seeing how they feel for a long period of time, i foresee no discomfort. I was a little skeptical at first about how they would sound when plugged into a PS4 controller, and was shocked. The sound quality, bass, stereo and depth of the sound was amazing!! I could here things so clearly like people running around in the game. I felt submerged into it, really brining life into the game. I have yet to use these for music or watching a movie. But I can tell especially when watching an action movie of any sort, these headsets will blow me away even more. I’m sure it will give me the feeling of being at a movie theater but with even better sound quality!!
