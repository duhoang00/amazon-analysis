"R2UBBP9NRQ5PXK","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2021",5,"Perfect replacement for my Logitech G610","I had a Logitech keyboard last. This is not a knock against them, as every other product of theirs I've bought (which is many) has served me well, but the G610 was failing earlier than expected. So I needed a new keyboard.Every Corsair product I've ever bought significantly exceeded my expectations. This naturally causes my expectations to rise still further, and this keyboard still beat them. The Cherry Speed switches are quieter than what my last keyboard had, which I love. The required pressing force and travel to actuate them are quite light, which is great for extended use to prevent finger fatigue. Just make sure you're able to only hit the keys you want to press. Accidental actuation is possible.It's noticeably narrower than my G610. I've reclaimed about 3 inches of width on my desk. The spacebar is textured for some reason, but it's fine with me. So is the removable wrist rest, which makes a little more sense. There are 3 brightness settings, plus off. The brightest should be easily visible unless you're standing in direct sunlight at midday. The dimmest won't be irritating in a darkened room.It has a USB pass-through, which requires plugging in a second cable. This is optional and the keyboard will work just fine with only the one cable plugged in (make sure it's the right one; they are labeled). It comes with several replacement keys, and a tool to help replace keys.I did not want to spend $200 on their newest flagship board.

I grew too accustomed to laptop keyboards in the mid 2000's, and then had a low-profile membrane gaming keyboard (Microsoft Sidewinder) for many years, and like that form factor. When I saw that Corsair, a brand I trust and whose mice I already adore, made a low profile mechanical board, I wanted to try it out. And it didn't disappoint! Love the mechanical feel, which is more stable and linear than the slightly wobbly keys of my old membrane board, without feeling uncomfortably tall like most standard mechanical boards feel to me.All the other features are awesome, too. The iCue software makes customizing the RGB super fun. You can program each key individually with dozens of patterns, in literally any color you can imagine. Corsair really has the best RGB ecosystem. On top of that, the USB passthrough is handy, and the media controls are super convenient. Also, the profile switch button makes it easy to change lighting on the fly, and since my computer lives near my bed, makes it easy to put my whole computer in ""stealth mode"" by switching to a profile that turns all the RGB off so it doesn't keep me up at night while my gaming rig passively mines crypto to help recoup the cost of building it.All in all, a solid 9.5/10.

"R2PC0IIPIZJ45C","Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2021",1,"Great Keyboard, Poor Lighting Quality","Update: I haven't even had the replacement keyboard a week and the escape key just flat out doesn't work. Do not buy this keyboard, it is pure junk.I really like the way this keyboard feels to type on. The low profile keys are nice, the switches are pretty quiet overall, and it feels very responsive. From a day to day use standpoint, I have absolutely zero complaints about this product. However, one of the reasons to buy a keyboard like this one is the lightning and that's where my issues begin.First, I am very, very lucky if iCUE, Corsair's peripheral management software, recognizes this keyboard, which means it's almost always either on the default rainbow state or stuck on one color (I have it set to rotate between three colors normally to match the lighting on my tower), plus I can't manage any of the keys or use custom keybinds. Often iCUE will even see the keyboard is connected but still won't let me manage it. This is remedied if I unplug it and plug it back in several times; basically, it will eventually always recognize it, but it's a question of how long I have to fidget with it and then a roll of the dice on how long it'll stay connected.Second, when it actually IS working with iCUE, typing on it causes the keys to randomly flash white on keystroke, which is definitely not a thing it should be doing. It's very distracting when every third or fourth keystroke causes the whole keyboard to be briefly bright white. This only happens when the keyboard's iCUE profile is actually working, though, so basically I am stuck with a situation where if the software doesn't see it, it doesn't work right, and if the software sees it, it doesn't work right in a completely different way.I sent the first of these back assuming it was a defect and the second one has all the exact same problems, so my suggestion would be to look elsewhere; I am sure you can get cheaper keyboards with similar keys and skip the lighting problems.",true,1,4,"13","B07H6MWLXS","corsair k70",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,457,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H6MWLXS","2147.90",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K70 RGB MK.2 Low Profile Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - Linear & Quiet, Backlit RGB LED, Cherry MX Low Profile Red","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zMyzhd6WL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The way I put my hand on the mouse, I often hold the right mouse button from the side and it feels ""sticky"" because it hangs off the side a bit too much.It works well with the Corsair iCue software and looks great. I especially like that you can control the whole setup from the mouse. The top two buttons switch between themes in the software so you can set profiles and cycle between them if you have RGB LED's in your rig like I do. Again, I wish they were more firm, because I keep hitting them and then my whole PC goes dark because I only have the one profile (for now). I just wish the keyboard didn't come damaged.The 6, Y. H, and B keys were all DOA. I assume they are connected in some way. The LED's lit up real nicely though. One of the keys also looked pressed in a bit. Perhaps that had something to do with it?

This is not a knock against them, as every other product of theirs I've bought (which is many) has served me well, but the G610 was failing earlier than expected. So I needed a new keyboard.Every Corsair product I've ever bought significantly exceeded my expectations. This naturally causes my expectations to rise still further, and this keyboard still beat them. The Cherry Speed switches are quieter than what my last keyboard had, which I love. The required pressing force and travel to actuate them are quite light, which is great for extended use to prevent finger fatigue. Just make sure you're able to only hit the keys you want to press. Accidental actuation is possible.It's noticeably narrower than my G610. I've reclaimed about 3 inches of width on my desk. The spacebar is textured for some reason, but it's fine with me. So is the removable wrist rest, which makes a little more sense. There are 3 brightness settings, plus off. The brightest should be easily visible unless you're standing in direct sunlight at midday. The dimmest won't be irritating in a darkened room.It has a USB pass-through, which requires plugging in a second cable. This is optional and the keyboard will work just fine with only the one cable plugged in (make sure it's the right one; they are labeled). It comes with several replacement keys, and a tool to help replace keys.I did not want to spend $200 on their newest flagship board.

"R2UOTYDJWTAWF3","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",5,"Excellent headset and versatility, but subpar software","I want to preface this by saying I've had this headset for a year and a half and has held up well through the somewhat torture I've given it! Keep in mind I use this headset anywhere from 10-25 hours a week so if that gives you any idea as to how much I've used these, do with that as you will. Anyways here's a pros and cons list to simplify it with a summary to recap my thoughts on this headset.Pros:-The versatility of these headphones is great mainly because you can plug them into your pc or console, charge them and keep playing or just use them while plugged in, AND connect them to your phone with an aux cord if you wanna walk around with them and blast music.-The sound quality is phenomenal with highs being crisp and lows being bassy and the mids filling the gaps to make a smoothsound or listening to music a joy. The sound isolation is great as you can hear the footsteps of someone below, above, behind. It makes a very immersive experience as it can turn a roar from a zombie around the corner go from ""ehh"", to ""holy hell what was that, and where did it come from"" experience. Not always obviously, but I've never gotten an experience like this from any other headset.-They look great, and have held up well even though I can be a bit rough with them from time to time.-When Icue works the customization for the EQ is impressive and enhances the experience if done right. Though careful, with a custom EQ, because if you push it too high or low you could have distortion issues. Something to be aware of as I feel this is more of a software issue rather than the headsets ability to produce the desired sound you want.-Mic quality is superb wireless and connected. I've never had anyone have problems with my mic quality being poor or choppy. Only time there's issues with this is either some software, program, or internet issues and not the mic itself.Cons:-Not a surprise but the cost is up there, but honestly I've gotten my money's worth and they keep going strong after a year and a half so it's a con, but small at this point.-The ear cups are not made to last. I did have to replace the ear cups after about 6 months of regular use, and it wasn't the most comfortable tbh, but I found bigger/better replacement Earcups from a 3rd party that were more much comfortable and have held up better (I have a big head and ears so this was a great find) at the cost of loss to noise canceling it is ""supposed"" to have.-Battery life on these are pretty good, but not 20 hours as they advertise. Even when they were brand new I was getting MAYBE 14-16 hours if conditions were perfect, but not 20. This being said the LI-Ion battery still gets me a solid 10 hours on a full charge and the recharge is quick so I can just throw the cable on to charge while staying in ""wireless"" mode and then 30min have passed and it's back to green again so it's a con for not completely accurate advertising, but not terrible battery life by any stretch. Just unrealistic.Cons unrelated to the headset itself, but corsairs software issues:-RGB... Idk WHY, when you turn on the headset, the mic goes RGB and shows the rainbow, but then you can not customize the mic color at all. WHY show that off and then not come through. Solid miss there.-until recently I HATED ICue but I had no choice but to use it for my headset, but with some recent updates it's gotten better. Less buggy and more dependable, but when my headset acts up I usually look at ICue first to make sure it isn't the, poor excuse for, software causing the issue.-ICue is just a very subpar app and honestly needs some major work. Idk why it's as buggy as it is because this headset deserved better than this. I won't drag the rating down because of something the app does wrong where as the headset itself is pretty dang great.-I'm lumping this in the software issue seeing as it's controlled through Icue is the 7.1 surround sound is not phenomenal. It's pretty good in some games that have surround sound features enabled, but for movies, shows, music ect. It's not great as it sometimes cuts out the mids HARD to the point where sometimes an explosion sounds muffled or just wonky for a lack of a better term. Also the higher frequencies tend to get swollowed up during bassier sequences in whatever it is so it leaves it feeling hollow in many scenes. My advice is stick with the stereo setting as it does a pretty great job of sounding equal and correct in any setting rather than hit or miss with everything. Nifty idea that fell flat imo.-voice prompts... Just... Don't use that setting...Finally the...Summary:Overall I maybe leaving a few things out, but most of the cons on the headset itself are little or not a deal breaker (atleast for me), but things to think on how to improve the virtuoso descendants going forward. I personally love the headset itself and there's more I could say, but at this point you'll have based most of your decision on what I said earlier if you even made it this far lol. My biggest gripes are the ICue software we're forced to deal with as it maybe ""esthetically"" pleasing to look at. It's a far cry from great, or even good. As it stands now it works mostly, but the bugs drive me insane. The lack of thought to letting people mess with the mics light colors is what lends me to believe it's lazy or just cheap to not let people do what they want which is just rediculous to me. I digress from this bit of rage here. In all a great headset itself, but poor software to harness all of the greatness.Headset - 9/10 few fixes/adjustments and it would probably be perfectSoftware (Icue) - was 3 - now after many updates later 6/10. If they could focus on a great customer experience and fix the bugs rather than just cheap implementation of features or lack there of for that matter, and some which haven't changed.

"R2VFD4UMJRT09D","Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2021",5,"It's expensive for a reason.","This is the first ""super high end"" keyboard I've bought.I laughed at the thought of spending more than $100 on a keyboard.However, my old one was having issues and I needed a new one.During my review searching, I kept seeing BlackWidow Elite mentioned. It showed up more than a few times.I checked it out and was like ""No! I'm not paying almost $200 for that!"" then I kept reading. And it showed up a lot.After doing tons of searching through Amazon, I ended up coming back to this one and doing more research. I was intrigued. I started looking for specific reviews about this keyboard. YouTube. Reddit. Amazon. And more...This keyboard has a lot going for it.It's surprising how many bells and whistles this comes with. Each individual key light can be controlled in some manner.The app for it (call Synapse...kind of like in the movie Antitrust) has tons of presets. And there's an entire community of people who make color themes for this. I love it. Someone is always coming up with something new and interesting.The app lets you set up macros and key binds for almost anything. And there's a bunch of other stuff I haven't even messed with.Synapse could use some QOL improvements and some upgrades. The layout design could use some love and navigating the app takes some getting used to. It's not horrible but there is definitely room for improvement. For what it is right now, it's a good app. I don't hate it.What I don't like is that the keyboard immediately prompts you to install Synapse as soon as you plug it in. I'm sure there are some people who want to use the keyboard as just a mechanical keyboard and they don't want to use the app. I'm not sure if this is an option for them, but it should be. A $200 keyboard should not force a software installation to be used.As I have not tried using my keyboard without Synapse, I can't expound on this topic other than to say the popup might be construed as ""invasive"" to some users.Another small thing I really like about the keyboard is the side USB plug. It's great for doing quick USB connecting and it's within arms reach at all times.I have USB 3.0 hub that I'm going to try connecting to it at some point to give me some additional ports.You also get a plug for audio in and audio out. I don't use these ports so they have no real effect on me and I can't comment on how the sound quality is. But I'm sure there are others who will love the quick audio port access. Especially if you have a tower that doesn't have easily accessible ports.Let's talk about the additional buttons that come with this. The ones not part of the standard 104.In the upper right corner, this keyboard comes with a spinner dial for controlling volume and a rather large mute button in the center of the dial. To the left of the dial are three media buttons. Rewind, play, and forward (in that order).Now, I like having media buttons. But I LOVE these things because, as a scripter, I can reassign these to do a multitude of things.Example: In my main script that I have running at all times, I wrote a piece of code that lets the dial control the main system volume normally but when the Windows key is held, the volume dial adjusts the sound of Winamp without me having to actually open Winamp (Winamp is a music player that has been around forever. I've used it for years and haven't found a better replacement for it.)On a side note, if you're curious about rebinding keys, making advanced custom macros, and more, check out the language AutoHotkey. It's completely free, it's one of the most user-friendly programming languages I know of, and the community loves teaching newcomers how to create programs. They have a very active main forum, subreddit, and Discord.Back to the review.Finally, I want to talk about the key switches. The Razer greens exceeded my expectations. I've been using this keyboard for long enough that I can comfortably say these keys are probably the best ones I've used.Before this, I had Cherry MX Blues and I loved those. But these greens seem like they're just a smidge better. They're really responsive. The pressure requirement per keypress is great. And I love the ""clack"" they make.There's something almost soothing and zen-like about listening to a keyboard talk as you create something.I do all the major things keyboards are used for: Gaming, coding, and composition.For gaming, it's all about response time and key pressure. The greens have been fantastic in both areas! I've set multiple new records on StepMania (think DDR for your fingers) using this keyboard. The switches seem to be so accurate that I'm hitting notes, rolls, and crossovers that I was having difficulties hitting before. I have a folder of favorite songs and I've gone up 1-2 grades on almost every song in there. Not only that, there are certain songs I had never finished that I've gotten past with this keyboard. I highly doubt that my skill level randomly jumped that much after getting this keyboard. Gotta give props where props are due.For coding and composition, all I care about is not missing keystrokes. Give me what I type.If I'm coding and I miss one letter/number, it can have a myriad of negative effects. It could be an easy error to find or it might be something so unnoticeable that it takes you forever to fix. Either way, I've never had an issue with keystrokes registering when I'm typing. And because the keyboard doesn't have a super high actuation rate, I don't get fatigued fingers after elongated sessions.Finally, I have never experienced any ghosting issues (that's where your keys don't register when you hold too many at once). Apparently, this keyboard has a 10-key rollover with anti-ghosting. I play a ton of different games and not ONCE have I had an issue where multiple keys were being held and some weren't registering. I've also noticed that comments like ""BULLS#@T!!! I did too hit that button!!"" have become almost non-existent. I couldn't be happier about that.TLDR: The BlackWidow Elite is a solid keyboard, it has great features, the Razer greens are some of the best switches I've ever used, the Synapse app is decent and has a lot of options, side ports are very convenient, the extra media buttons are always welcome, and it never ghosts or miss keystrokes.10/10 would buy again.*Authentic Greg Review*Thanks for reading this review.

"R1FRW9RUUQ0DB1","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",2,"Great initially, but not built to last","I bought this keyboard in November of 2018. I am a casual gamer, and I really enjoyed the bright colors and the Cherry MX Speed keys. I have never had a keyboard with dedicated macro keys before, and the keyboard itself seemed quite sturdy.Fast-forward to today, and I am having some annoying difficulties with this keyboard that others have noted in the reviews. It does not happen every time, but often when I try to type an ""A"" it ends up writing ""AA"" or ""AAA"". It does not happen every time I press the button either, which only makes it more annoying. As another reviewer noted, this seems to be due to using WASD keys more than the others.In addition, I find that the spacebar is difficult to use in some games. Unless I perfectly hit it in the middle on every press, it will over time begin to slope downward to the left (when my left hand is on WASD my thumb naturally falls just left of the center of the spacebar). This eventually results in the spacebar not registering all of my presses until I press down on the right side and get it back to level.Lastly, switching between users on my computer often causes the keyboard software to glitch and refuse to work until I unplug the USB and plug it back in.None of these issues seem like major concerns, but I bought this keyboard thinking that it would last longer than 3 years.

My major problem with this keyboard is the keys start to break.The plastic that makes up the cross pattern that connects the key to the keyboard seems to be very weak. Within about 2 months or so of owning it, the left side control key broke. To Corsairs credit they sent me a replacement key very quickly, but a few months after that the right control key started to come loose.What I have noticed is it is the keys that are around the edge of the keyboard that have the issue. What I believe it to be is it is the keys that you aren’t pressing at a straight up and down, it is the keys that you are reaching over to with your pinky fingers that are really the problem. I have a feeling overtime they would all start to break down, but the ones that are getting more pressure at an angle are just breaking first.Long story short, I replacing this and going back to my trusted Logitech keyboard because, while their customer service was great, I can’t be waiting for replacement keys every couple months.If this is primarily used for gaming and not a combination of day-to-day and gaming I would say it will last you a while, but if you’re thinking about getting this for your day-to-day I wouldn’t recommend it.",true,1,19,"118","B01MS0I1ZK","corsair k70",false,198.99,"USD",0,0,0,5028,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MS0I1ZK","23128.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard -6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Tac...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71niQiKL9lL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I've never created any before this and use the Icue system it was realitivly easy to figure out but there was a slight learning curve through guess and check but got everything working the way i wanted. Lightning is great and customizable. easy to switch it up or just cut it off.Now for the errors. seems to be few. Had to uninstall and reinstall the icue system because it got corrupted two times during my use somehow. Had a few issues reinstalling and getting everything working the 2nd time.The biggest annoyance (at least its something small) is the volume buttons on top right to mute, lower or raise the volume will just stop working. ill restart icue but that wont work. The only way to fix this is either A: restarting the computer sometimes fixes it. B: Go to settings in Icue and force update the firmware. even though you are currently on that firmware you have to force update it so it starts working again. While this is a rather simple fix.

Also, the abbreviated keycaps PSC, SLK, BRK, etc., puts my brain on pause every time I look at those keys. Finally, the tactile bumps on the F and J keys are way too subtle for my sense of touch.)Integrated USB Port (I don't need or want it, nor do I want the resulting increase in the diameter of the keyboard cord.)No large L-shaped Enter key.Yeah, I still miss that!",true,1,21,"120","B082GRKQYF","corsair k70",true,139.99,"USD",199.99,60,30,2231,4.8,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082GRKQYF","10708.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum XT Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit RGB LED, Cherry MX RGB Brown, Black","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7193Jl8PejL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
