"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,1,"11","B07QX9C9WH","corsair darkcore",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,true,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R17S99462UVJM3","Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2021",1,"Pretty painful for beginners","Edit: still dealing with customer service via snail mail basically, one response a day and I’m pretty sure it’s different people because I get asked the same questions. Going to likely and painfully return this horrible product especially after hearing this happen to others.Edit: this product is the most frustrating experience, nothing lights up properly and customer service told me I had to play email tag because their “tech support” doesn’t cover troubleshooting this and the people that do only answer by email. Sometimes 2 fans light up, other times just one but never all 3 and nothing else in the kit has ever lit up as intended. Stay away.This product comes in great packaging and you really feel like you got value for money especially when you tally up the individual items.It’s also not the cheapest, but I wanted to get something higher quality being my first time and all, but this wasn’t quite the case.To begin I learned the pipes were called something that’s just a fancy word for acrylic, and I learned very fast that it’s not very forgiving and easy to mess up. Couple that with the types of adapters you get which pretty much commit you to hardline tubing and you are stuck either with attempting to use them (and in my case immediately messing up a tube despite watching videos prior,) or investing a lot more money to get better tubes or different adapters, but it doesn’t end there…It comes with a squeeze container for filling the pump which broke off inside just from using, that was 2 hours of draining and playing rubik’s cube trying to get out, not fun. But it doesn’t end there either…The pump is awkward as heck, if you have it all plugged in the thing doesn’t operate at full power when filling and you are stuck trying to figure out why the tubes aren’t filling, why does it gotta be like that?The directions aren’t the best, and this process was very painful, I got coolant all over my motherboard and cards despite my best intent to cover everything which yes, is part to user error but I also feel the acrylic isn’t the best use and I wish there were more options from Corsair like being able to buy a kit with soft tubing.

"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better.

"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

I figured I was just unlucky and grabbed another because I really like the design of the mouse and how it feels in my hand. However, I am already having issues with this mouse giving the double click issue as well, this time with the right mouse button. I've had this one for even less time than the previous. For something that costs 80 dollars this really isn't acceptable and I will be switching to a different brand for my next one.Also, iCue is the worst software package I have ever used, and is basically required to get any sort of functionality out of the mmo buttons on the side.The Logitech mmo mouse (G600) while not looking nearly as attractive lasted me for about 5 years before I finally gave it to a friend after picking up my first Scimitar. He's still using that mouse. It also comes in at half the price and has a ""better"" software setup. Not that Logi's is amazing either, but it's far better than iCue.

None have fit my hold style like this does, and its manly due to the pinky rest attachment which makes it fantastic to grip.The software is decent, takes a bit of time to upload changes to the mouse but not a big deal since its unlikely to constantly change those settings once set to ones liking.I was worried the weight wouldn't be to my liking (I prefer the lightest mice) but it really doesn't feel as heavy as it sounds.Excellent on either desk top or on a mouse pad, I find it rare when a mouse has feet that feel nice without a mouse pad.The negatives are:-Barrel scroll wheel is bit difficult to reach but this may just be due to my strange hold style.-Main scroll wheel sometimes doesnt register a scroll, this is also an issue on razer and logitech mice I've used (why do high end mice seem to have scroll wheels that cant detect correctly on each scroll?).",true,1,16,"116","B07P5VCGF4","corsair darkcore",true,65.26,"USD",72.99,7.73,10.59,1056,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5VCGF4","4646.40",false,false,false,false,"Mad Catz The Authentic R.A.T.

"R39KG38763SPB3","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",2,"Underwhelming","I purchased the 8+ White. At the time of purchase, it was a little under $90 USD. TL;DR: sub-par build quality, poor ergonomics, and weird design decisions.Let's start with the good:I'm a sucker for weird computer peripherals, and this definitely delivers in that regard. The customization is nice -- being able to swap out palm rests, adjusting the angle of the thumb rest, or modifying the weight is cool. There's a lot that can be done to make it fit your hand, and I respect that.I found the software to be adequate as well. Windows only for the software, though any edits you make are saved to the mouse directly so it'll work on Linux or Mac. (But keep in mind for Mac, there aren't any bindings in the software for CMD, if you have any intention of using this for complex Mac-specific macros. This doesn't affect my score since this is advertised as Windows-only, which is fair.)It's easy-ish to open up. Just threes screws and a bit of finesse. Repairability seems feasible.Unfortunately, there isn't much else I can say about it that's good besides it's a functioning mouse.Here are a handful of my issues with the device:- Poor build quality.One of the first things I noticed after opening and inspecting the mouse was that one of the plastic top panels was loose. It's not that it was screwed in wrong or anything (I opened the mouse up to check), but rather that the plastic just wasn't molded to properly fit. It's not a huge deal, but there's a noticeable gap about the size of my fingernail that sits between the top panel with the ""RAT 8+"" logo and the black frame underneath.Basically every button on the mouse has some crazy wobble to it, especially the right mouse button and middle DPI switch on mine. I shimmed some of the empty space with small bits of paper to reduce the wobble, which worked. Although if you want to do this for the DPI switch, you'll have to open up the mouse.Another gripe: Out of the box, I couldn't get the adjustment tool to work on any of the thumb rest adjustments. They were super tight, to the point of where I needed a screwdriver to loosen them. Maybe just an issue on my unit, but keep in mind it might be helpful to have a small hex allen wrench on hand.- Bad ergonomics.I understand this is subjective, so I'm not factoring this too heavily into my score. But despite all the customizability, my hand always had a tendency to feel sore after using it for long periods of time, no matter how many configurations I tried. It's probably okay for shorter gaming sessions, but if you're also using this for productivity, you might have comfort issues. My hands are slim and maybe small-medium in size, for reference.- Weird design decisions.On the thumb rest, there's a screw hole right behind the sniper button where your thumb will likely naturally rest. At first thought, no issue. But after only like a month of using this mouse, everything around that screw hole is covered in grime. I wash my hands just as much as the next guy, so bear in mind this area might need some extra attention when cleaning.Another weird one is the pinky rest attachment, which I wanted to love. Unfortunately, it has an issue where it didn't actually make physical contact with the desk, instead hovering like 2mm above it. Sounds reasonable: less contact, less friction when gaming, right? Well -- with the size and weight of the pinky rest, the reality of the situation is that even the slightest bit of unbalanced pressure from your hand means your mouse is now lopsided and leaning to the right. It's super easy to run into this unintentionally, and it makes the whole thing just feel poorly thought out and engineered. A quick fix: find an old mouse you're not using, peel off one of the smaller skates from the bottom, and then stick that onto the pinky rest's skate. That should close the gap and reduce the tendency to tilt to the right. It'll introduce more drag, but you're probably not going to be using the pinky rest for gaming anyways because of how huge it is.Finally, I want to mention the weight of this mouse. It's heavy. I don't know the exact numbers, but I was only able to get this to a comfortable weight by removing all of the included weights, as well as the spring + adjustment tool under the palm rest. If you want a light mouse for gaming, this isn't it.Other thoughts, that don't reflect my rating:- I really don't know what to use the horizontal scroll wheel for. I mean, sure, horizontal scrolling -- but I do that so rarely it feels overkill to have a separate wheel dedicated to it. I used the software to bind page up/down to the wheel to try it out as a super-fast scrolling solution, like some knock-off Logitech frictionless scroll. It was adequate. Maybe other people will find more use for it than me.- This mouse loves its decals. It's a bit of a detractor for me. I honestly think this thing would look a lot nicer with maybe just a single Mad Catz logo somewhere. The palm rests are extra weird, they have this "" 0 -- 5 -- 10 -- 15 -- 20"" ruler-like thing printed on but it's totally non-functional and looks weird. It'd look better blank.- My cursor had a tendency to ""jump"" around sometimes. I think the sensor might have been calibrated weirdly. There's an option to do this in the software. Not sure if mine was defective, but it didn't bother me enough to try to recalibrate it while I was using the mouse. Seemed to only happen just after the mouse was lifted + set back down.- I'm no longer using this mouse. I managed to replace the broken scroll encoder on my Swiftpoint Z, and I'm going back to that as my daily driver.",true,1,16,"116","B07P5VCGF4","corsair darkcore",true,65.26,"USD",72.99,7.73,10.59,1056,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P5VCGF4","4646.40",false,false,false,false,"Mad Catz The Authentic R.A.T.

"R26NDXW4MB313","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2021",5,"A Good Mouse, Surprisingly Works Well","I didn't expect much from this mouse being wireless and all, but it surprised me.The most important thing here is that it feels very similar to my older RAT8, same shape, same size, only unlike the RAT8 which comes with some weird silicon coating or a gloss coating, the DWS comes with a nice matte plastic that feels really nice -- some say it feels like cheap plastic, it really does not. Really good feel. And it looks really nice in person too, love the Silver & Black. The other difference is the side trigger, better placement and a larger button and bit more flat so it feels much more comfortable reaching your thumb over to press.The Wireless options are good. Bluetooth and 2.4G connections are good. It seems the 2.4G connection is much smoother however, sometimes the Bluetooth connection will stutter after turning it off and back on. So far I haven't experienced any significant lag or issues with 2.4G as I historically did with older tech, but it's not 100% perfect as I do see a hiccup here or there. Nothing I'd really call a deal breaker.I run on a 144Hz gaming monitor and the mouse movements are smoother than other wireless mice, but not as smooth as my wired RAT8. I would say the smooth mouse movements on the DWS are about 85% of my wired RAT8, which means for gaming I would notice a slight drop in smoothness, but honestly, unless you're staring at the mouse cursor directly as you move it left and right real fast, it isn't very noticeable.The clicking feels good, but a bit more stiff than the RAT8 (likely because it's new). The only thing I don't like is how the mouse feels when scrolling down, it's has much harder rolling-ticks down than scrolling up, and sometimes it feels like it's missing some of these scrolls, so when browsing web pages, it'll scroll, stall for half a second and scroll again. I wonder if this one mouse is somewhat messed up with this one issue -- then again my RAT8 will also do this from time to time — but not as much.Overall I really like this mouse.

"R2I3U1V0GD0E","Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2021",2,"HEAR ME OUT FIRST","I purchased this product (March 14,2020) at the start of the Corona Pandemic. (Take note of this)I have medium size hands and its the most comfortable mouse up to date, there is a discomfort feeling at the bottom of my thumb where the mouse has a small ""hedge"" after 7+ hours of using the mouse. Apart from everything else I love the mouse from the button location and length to the infinite spinning wheel or manual wheel even to the customization of the color and DPI.Now you're thinking, why would this product have 2 stars? Well simply put, I have pets and one of my munchkins is known for biting wires, so it would be logical to invest in a Bluetooth mouse for this and apart from gaming as well. The problem I have with this mouse is that the Bluetooth is completely miss for me! I cannot say the same for others. Now I figured it may have been a lemon or so and I contacted support through Logitech on JULY of 2020, and from all the steps I've taken to ensure it was a lemon product, I received a confirmation that I would have a replacement, due to Corona I did not receive an email from them when they would eventually be in stock. Fast forward to Late January of 2021 I decided that my mouse needed to be replaced ASAP. I NEED my Bluetooth connectivity so I had a chat with the same representative from the start and I wanted to compromise with something of the same value or greater, which I was more than happy to pay and they decided to send me a Logitech G903 which IS NOT THE SAME VERSION BUT A NEWER MODEL. And So I was happy with this compromise, I as well couldn't return the defected one which is understandable to a degree, but that didn't stop me from wanting to know the problem of the continuous Bluetooth disconnection. A few weeks pass and I receive the newer mouse in a white box which wasn't the same as a new box; though the representative didn't say if it was new or not so I didn't care at the end of the day. There wasn't visible use of the mouse (no fingerprints, plastic still protecting the bottom, all parts included) after a week of Bluetooth use the problems persisted.-Using Bluetooth will make the mouse turn on and off which makes the cursor reappear in a new spot(this was annoying when I would play videogames and the constant sounds going on and off as well)-The battery wasn't accurate as well, I would have to charge it for an hour or more to see it fully charge and have the Bluetooth fail on me again. I would figure Problem 1 and 2 went hand in hand.-Yes I did try both mice on different Laptops/PC's and still had the same problem.-Yes I've done everything in my power to test the adapter as well, from different ports to disabling NVIDIA settings etc.Now you're thinking I'm not considering buying this mouse. I couldn't agree more, BUT I did love Logitech's customer support, and this Logitech G900/G903 will not steer me away from their other mice I will consider buying in the future.

The expense and headache never end (7 years now). The exception to the rule = Corsair’s XD7 water loop system. I must come out of the shadows with this thing.If you are on a budget = stop reading right now… go to the Financial Aid office and ask for money to support your bad computer habit (cuz you are in trouble dude).Even if this ‘work of art’ fails tomorrow, I will enjoy this moment. I give THANOS credit to the engineering and designers of this pump. It makes perfect sense and saves a lot of space in an EATX case (or perhaps smaller).Along with this unit – the picture shows the Corsair XC7 RGB (CPU cold plate) and the Corsair XG7 RGB (GPU water block / cold plate). And I never thought I would be staring at my own …. for three days without blinking my eyes. (see photo)Tech Specs:> The XG7 (Rev B) is a perfect fit for my EVGA 2080 XC – which is a reference card (meaning NVIDIA gives the reference and EVGA slaps two fans and a shroud over the …..) If your card is bigger than a reference size (10.5 inches long) – then you will likely shed tears finding the correct block (sorry). The problem for many is thickness (like capacitors and extra cooling junk).> The XC7 is a perfect fit for my Intel socket LGA 1200 processor (or any other); Corsair gives you the back plate and spring-loaded screws which can be mounted to where they don’t flop around on install.Advice:Remember: this is just a water pump with pretty lights and outrageous plumbing. The rest is up to you and extensive research. I had to watch several YOUTUBE videos that didn’t teach me nothing about setting up a custom loop (good for reference only or nothing at all). Takes a bit of time…But I know one rule = buy two of everything you can’t find at WALMART or BESTBUY. I needed (12) compression fittings (which come 4 to a box). I needed (2) 90-degree fittings. I did the calculations before I started. Surprisingly, the Corsair hose and coolant (1000 ml) was enough to do the entire build (can’t waste nothing testing).Hope this helps…",true,1,21,"121","B08HSQV5NZ","corsair darkcore",false,154.99,"USD",0,0,0,448,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HSQV5NZ","2016.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Hydro X Series XD5 RGB Pump/Reservoir Combo - D5 PWM Pump - 330ml Reservoir - Ten Individually Addr...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Bw1KiAW8L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R3DODNDM886YTD","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2021",1,"Loud, unreliable, and poorly made product","I have used Corsair products for a long time, so I was expecting a quality item like the peripherals I trust. However, this cooler was an extreme let-down to the point where I won't let any Corsair AIO coolers near my rig again. Here's the skinny:- The install was very frustrating. The radiator I received had holes that were very poorly tapped, with a large amount of metal shavings obstructing the threads. It was so bad that even the right sized Philips bit would torque right out of the head rather than threading it in, I nearly punctured the radiator just trying to thread in the screws thanks to this.- The cooler isn't that effective when it does work, the laughably poorly designed fans cavitate something awful all the time. This means it's annoyingly loud at idle and completely deafening under any load.- The software is AWFUL. I have a lot of experience with iCue; It's a great program for tuning the functionality of non-mission-critical PC components. Its reliability is spotty at best though, it tends to crash every once in a while when it's in the background tray. The buggy software combined with the complete necessity of the AIO pump running is a recipe for disaster.- To further elaborate, this cooler needs to plug into a USB header on the mobo to work, and the computer considers it a USB device after you boot up. But then every time iCue crashes, the software control of the AIO fails too, meaning the pump will briefly shut off. The USB connect also means every other USB connected device will also be disconnected from the computer, meaning it starts to overheat and you can't do anything to stop it short of yanking the power cord.- The fix for the above issue is to *wait for it* update the firmware through iCue. To do this, you click a button in the software and it does its thing. Except, it actually doesn't, it just shuts off the AIO completely while waiting for a response that will never come and you get to watch your CPU rapidly cook itself alive. I saw my core temp soar to 105 C before I pulled the plug. Looking online, this is clearly a common issue and the only solution is to contact Corsair support and wait for them to bail you out.I had the foresight to save my old cooler to re-install in case this went bad, and boy did it ever.Corsair, if you're reading this, I'm really disappointed with this cooler and my half-baked CPU is too.",true,1,22,"122","B0829RTMKY","corsair darkcore",true,109.99,"USD",119.99,10,8.33,7958,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0829RTMKY","37402.60",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair iCUE H100i RGB Pro XT, 240mm Radiator","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lZhlM3cxL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
