The instructions come in the way of a simple graphical sheet that seems to indicate you just plug it in, so I did what most people would do and powered down my unit and plugged this in. After powering up, I transferred some of my games and apps from the internal drive to this without problem.However, when I went to play a game or start an app that I had transferred to the Seagate, I got an error that it would not run. After some sleuthing online, I found someone in a forum relating that he was told to leave the power on while plugging in the device.

Read the reviews. It's not a fake, fly through the mud in some super powered vehicle Sim game. This game is the ""Dark Souls"" of simulators. Snowrunner seems slightly easier to me than the previous title (maybe just because I'm used to the game play now?), but they have a Hard Mode that changes the game play and makes it quite enjoyable for people who want to drag it out and keep more difficulty. :) Highly recommend and if you like it get the season 1 DLC at least. For 25 bucks (current going price of the DLC m) you get a LOT more maps content than even came with the original game. Season two isn't fully out yet, but I assume it will be the same level of content.
