Nintendo has always done well in terms of fit and finish, this is an absolute exception. Stitching seams for the white fabric are all over the place. And, the case seems 5% too big.2.) no dedicated joystick cutouts makes this case destroy your joycons especially if you have rubber joystick caps. Once you zip up the case, the case will put a lot of pressure on top of the joystick making it pressed down the whole time. This will not make your joycons last long.3.) the stand is actually pretty good but I would rather have it face the other way. The switch won’t stay up if you use the other side.4.) for its price and no hard shell, value for money is pretty low.Everyone has different uses for a case, some like it because it looks cool and they have the whole “set” while others need it for actual protection.

"R1IQDD91ZI31GE","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2021",4,"Like Stardew Valley, but cuter","In this game, you play as a soldier sent from the Capital to protect a village against monster attacks. You learn your ancestor has a farm of their own, and move into the house there. The story develops as you continue to assist the village and your fellow soldiers with their tasks, giving you access to new areas, items, and spells.This feels like Stardew Valley (closest comparison I can make), only far more fun to play, with more proper RPG elements. I tried Stardew Valley and quit a few hours in, but I binged this one on release day way past midnight. The art style is adorable, the characters are cute, and the humor is spot-on. The combat is simple enough for anyone to pick it up, but also requires enough attention that you can't just button mash. Elite Enemies are non-aggressive so they won't flatten your butt when you encounter them in a starting area- but give you a goal to get strong enough to slay them down the road. The combat also lets you pick styles of combat: Ranged, Melee, or Magic. To use your Active abilities, you need to strike enemies multiple times to restore uses of your ability dots. I like the variety, and the attacks and dodges feel rewarding. Danger areas are shown of monster attacks, and once you learn the timings of them, you can effectively dodge even head-on attacks. Money can be made in this game from simple farming to selling drops you get from monsters. It doesn't force you down one specific path for money.. (Though I would recommend hoarding until you buy weapon/armor upgrades you want- The grind to upgrade equipment is very slow, probably due to the relatively limited amount of equipment items in the game)Now for the criticism. Of course, it's not PERFECT. Nothing really is. If I had to criticize, I'd ask for a run button or better fast travel- Fast Travel exists to certain hubs, but the ""checkpoint"" system is where I had minor grievances. You can fast travel TO a checkpoint, but not FROM it. Meaning sometimes, you have to run across several fields and loading screens to get back to a hub. It's annoying due to the fact that time passes super quickly in the game, and a jog from a checkpoint back to the main village can easily cost you a couple of in-game hours, which is critical, as most shops only run from 7 am to 7 pm. So if you lose 4 hours, that's 1/3 of your day gone. I feel like the game should also pause when you're in your inventory or quest log- it's a bit of a hassle to worry about time while I'm reading on what I need to do on a quest. Also, as I mentioned earlier- the grind can be quite a pain. For example, you may have to kill 30+ orcs for a SINGLE weapon upgrade.Bottom line, this game is worth every penny I paid, and I'm going to be putting tons of hours into it. The majority of the hours will be ignoring the game world being in danger because I'm too busy working on my farm.",true,1,9,"19","B095Q7QV7H","nintendo switch oled",false,39.99,"USD",0,0,0,82,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095Q7QV7H","360.80",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Kitaria Fables - Nintendo Switch","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/715OEHQLfUS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The biggest jaw drop I have had so far is how they got Doom Eternal to run at all on the switch. I play that on pc a lot. Yes I can tell the difference, but in handheld mode and be able to take Doom Eternal anywhere I go, is simply amazing! I don't care how much reviewers down the graphics. The fact that its on there, stable 30fps and contains the entire game without massive problems is highly amazing to me. There are so many games that I did not expect to be on the switch and the fact I can play those games that I have on my pc and play them anywhere, regardless of downplayed graphics, is mind blowing.Even if they make a new switch this yr or next, its worth getting.

It had my favorite features of Zelda games where you gradually collect unique items that allow you to do more things throughout the game (some more useful than others) but in this one there wasn’t a lot of back tracking to use these new items in places I had already been which I usually actually like to do. There wasn’t enough side quests or villager interaction. I enjoyed playing it both handheld and motion controls though my lazy ass preferred handheld. Both ways had some hiccups but nothing to ruin the experience.The biggest complaint that I have is that one of the big bosses that was the most annoying and wonky to fight was one that you have to fight three separate times…It’s a good game that’s worth the play but not top three material.",true,1,13,"113","B08WWFWRY6","nintendo switch oled",false,59.99,"USD",0,0,0,5943,4.8,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WWFWRY6","28526.40",false,false,false,false,"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD - Nintendo Switch","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y8cNk-v1L._AC_UY218_.jpg"
