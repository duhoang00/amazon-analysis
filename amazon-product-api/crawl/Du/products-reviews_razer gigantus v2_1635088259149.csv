"R37NEA2RQ5YJM9","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2021",5,"Low profile high performance mouse surface","I bought this to replace an 8-year-old Razer Sphex skin, which was almost identical other than the size and design. The Sphex was being used on the tiny computer desk in our family room. I like having a low profile mouse pad on that desk which doesn't stick out. The Sphex did well considering how much use it got, and how my daughter liked to lift up the edges and crease them with her nails during online class until tiny pieces eventually tore up bit by bit.I like the design of these pads. The Sphex was accurately called a desktop skin, which is what it is. This new one's called 'thin mouse pad', which can be misleading. It's basically a piece of plastic that's smooth and tacky on one side (to stay in place), and textured on the other side to give good mouse performance. This new version has a cloth 'tag' that you can use to pull it up and reposition it. These are very easy to reposition, but only as long as you keep the tacky side off the table as little as possible so it doesn't collect dust, and make sure any surface you move it to is cleaned thoroughly. You also have to be careful not to crease it, since any crease on this material is permanent and will always show. For all these reasons, this is NOT appropriate as a travel mouse pad.I was initially worried that the design on this would be too bright, but the actual mousepad has more muted colors than in the pictures.

"R28KEZH77S4MSX","Reviewed in Italy on October 14, 2021",,"Razer Sphex V2: antiscivolo e super veloce!","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. ✔️ È antiscivolo!Inizio da qui perché ero titubante sull'acquisto leggendo le altre recensioni. Il tappetino arriva con una pellicola super sottile e super trasparente applicata sul retro. Sembra che non ci sia! Per notarla e rimuoverla correttamente, bisogna guardare attentamente nel punto che ho indicato nella foto: vicino la linguetta Razer. Se non rimuoverete la pellicola che protegge lo strato antiscivolo, ovviamente il tappetino non sarà antiscivolo.Una volta rimossa, basterà pulire bene la superficie della scrivania, posare il tappetino e questo non si schioderà più (come si può vedere in video, dove scuoto la scrivania ma il tappetino non cede di 1mm!). Naturalmente è possibile sollevarlo intenzionalmente, sempre attraverso la linguetta Razer (non è adesivo!).✔️ Super veloce!A me piacciono i micro movimenti. Sono abituato da tanti anni a usare la massima sensibilità sui mouse proprio per muovere il meno possibile il polso. Per lo stesso motivo sono abituatissimo ai mini tappetini. La texture di questo tappetino è straordinaria. Sembra di poter far scorrere il mouse semplicemente soffiando.❗ Occhio ai piedini!La scorrevolezza dei tappetini duri si paga con un consumo più rapido dei piedini del mouse.Se giocate a sparatutto e, in generale, a titoli che richiedono precisione, vi serve attrito e quindi un tappetino morbido.
