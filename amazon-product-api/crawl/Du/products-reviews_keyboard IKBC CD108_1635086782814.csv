The keyboard feels heavy and solid, so I had confidence in it working well and being reliable. However, lately the space bar has been acting up. It 'duds' sometimes causing the space bar to not travel straight down, especially when hitting it off center towards the right side.This is very annoying as space bar strokes are almost by definition (two hand typing) off-center. This is definitely something with the underlying mechanics in the keyboard or the stabilizing mounts.This has become a real nuisance, I am with some regularity missing entire space bar strokes, which is sadness, I liked this keyboard otherwise, but I am afraid I will have to junk it, missing 1 out of N key strokes is simply unacceptable.POST EDIT: I contacted the seller who advised to remove the space bar and clean the stabilizers, which didn't really help much, but now I have a 2nd problem that the Caps Lock and ESC keys sometimes output garbage which could either be indicators of dirt or short on the circuit, or a break in the circuit?It looks impossible to clean this keyboard internally without desoldering the whole thing, remvoing the external housing doesn't do much other than concluding that the board and is inaccessible, so if there were an issue that can be fixed, there is no way to get there",true,1,1,"10","B0875TLV55","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,280,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0875TLV55","1260.00",false,false,false,false,"iKBC CD108 V2 Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Clear Switch for Windows and Mac, Full Size Keyboard Upgraded w...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NUI1h95ML._AC_UY218_.jpg"

This interference occurs enough that I would say even for typing/document work it's annoying enough to recommend avoiding.",true,1,15,"114","B084GMXD3S","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,96.99,"USD",0,0,0,58,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084GMXD3S","237.80",false,false,false,false,"iKBC W200 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Brown Switch for Windows and Mac OS, Enables Media Key and LED Indic...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TLUqMDYzL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I did not know mechanical keyboards were a thing until this past month. I've been geeking out on them since, and have tried several, with wireless being my essential requirement.As keyboard geeks know, this limits the selection. I sampled several different brands (with Brown, Red, and Topre switches) but was not too impressed and sent each of them back. Some used Bluetooth and establishing connections was not always easy. The dongle/2.4 setup is best for wireless.These Cherry Blues are heavenly and this iKBC keyboard is the One. The wireless works perfectly with no perceptible lag when I'm typing at 100 wpm.

"R1EWIX4Y6FOEQW","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2021",5,"Small keycaps?Odd complaint","1.) ""Small"" keycaps.I was reading through the Amazon reviews on this keyboard and I was somewhat alarmed by the one that complained about the size of the keycaps.These keys are a very normal size.They width of the top of the key is .515"" according to my calipers (13mm).2.) With or without number pad?So I use this keyboard with either a mouse or a touchpad sitting just to the right of the keyboard.Since I use the mouse/touchpad so frequently, I find that the reduced distance I need to travel in order to get to the keyboard/mouse is wonderful, so I recommend omitting the number pad.I have a second keyboard that has a number pad that I can pull out if I have a bunch of number data entry to do, but for daily typing tasks, I don't feel like I'm missing much by not having the number pad.3.) Feeling of the key action (aka the switches).I got the Cherry MX brown switches.They seem great, but I'm not a mechanical switch aficionado.I would love to have tried them all out side by side, but I'm happy with the browns.They aren't too loud, but they're definitely not silent.My laptop keyboard and my other keyboard (Microsoft wireless bluetooth keyboard) are both virtually silent.4.) Typing speed.I type pretty quickly, and although I feel like I'm still getting used to this bad boy, I find that the responsiveness is very good, and I did a quick typing test online to see the how I was doing on the new keys.The Microsoft keyboard requires quite a bit of force to depress each key.The Cherry browns are definitely a much lighter actuation force.I found that I was immediately able to type about 15-20% faster which I attribute mostly to the lighter key actuation force and the solidity of the keyboard.5.) Build quality.Last thing I'll mention is that this keyboard is heavy.It feels well built and I suspect that it will last me for a long long time.Maybe (hopefully) a lifetime.6.) Scratchiness on the keystroke.There was a complaint from another reviewer that the keys felt a little scratchy on the way down as they are being depressed (They compared the feeling to another mechanical keyboard that they had used which felt ""silky smooth"").I notice this as well.I'm not sure if it bothers me, but I agree that it is noticeable.All that said, I have only had the keyboard for a day, so take it with a grain of salt.We'll see what I think in a year about this guy.",true,1,15,"114","B084GMXD3S","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,96.99,"USD",0,0,0,58,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084GMXD3S","237.80",false,false,false,false,"iKBC W200 Wireless Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Brown Switch for Windows and Mac OS, Enables Media Key and LED Indic...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71TLUqMDYzL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R8YQ1G7VUH60Q","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021",5,"Phenomenal! ...But Takes Some Getting Used To","Okay so I absolutely love this keyboard, no doubt about that now. It wasn't like that at first though.I initially purchased the keyboard for my first gaming desktop PC (avid longtime PC gamer, putting in 80-90 hours every week on average back on my gaming laptops) and I liked the black/white aesthetic that matched my PC and speakers, but also because of its minimalist design and THE VOLUME KNOB <3Upon first getting it and using it however, I found myself accidentally pressing other keys by accident because they aren't spaced very far apart and don't take a lot of force to press. Honestly I almost considered returning it after a few days because I hated all the misspellings I was making and having to correct.After a few weeks of usage though I suddenly realised that I wasn't making misspellings hardly at all anymore and my fingers had already memorised the placement of all the keys so I don't even look at the keyboard when I type now.So for anyone who just got this keyboard and is having a similar issue, just stick with it for a few more weeks and I promise you it gets better! For anyone on the fence about it, just be aware that you may have this issue at first but like I told the current users, you get used to the keyboard after a short while!Alright here's the Pros/Cons list: The Cons: - The narrow spacing between keys can lead to some accidental key presses in the early days of getting used to the keyboard - It isn't wireless (this may or may not be a con for some people, I personally don't care much) - Um... I think that's it?And the Pros: - Typing is pretty quiet compared to a lot of other keyboards! My roommate said he was glad I switched to this keyboard finally just because he could finally read in peace haha. Combine this keyboard with the Emopeak silent mouse and you've got a nice quiet setup, though that mouse may be a bit small for some people. - The ever-so-silky smooth volume knob! I honestly can't get over how nice the knob is. It has the perfect amount of resistance when turning it, its metal construction makes it feel very premium, and if you want to mute the volume, you can just press it down to mute instead of turning the knob to the left. I refuse to get another keyboard that doesn't have a volume knob. - The individually-backlit keys! There's plenty of lighting pattern customisation, from the speed of the animations to the brightness as well---and of course there is the ability to have the keys constantly illuminated or not at all. - The ability to set a PIN to unlock the keyboard when turning it on--to prevent any unwanted users accessing your keyboard/PC - Low profile makes it a good entry-level keyboard for long-time laptop users wanting to get into the desktop world. - Very portable since it has a low profile, isn't very large, and the USB-C to USB-A cable is detachable. - Media control buttons in the top right of the keyboard! I'd've preferred the Play button to be between the Previous and Next buttons instead of the button order being Play, Previous, Next. They still work great though and I love using these in conjunction with the volume knob when listening to music. - Also the calculator button, right next to the media control buttons. Didn't think this was something I'd put on the list of pros for a keyboard review but honestly I use it far more often than I ever thought I would. - Great build quality! I saw a previous 1-star review saying that many keys stopped working for them after a few weeks or months of use but I've been using my keyboard for 12-13 hours almost every single day now for over a year and I have had absolutely ZERO problems in all that time.So I'm not sure what that person may or may not have done to their keyboard or if they just happen to have received a faulty model but their case about their keyboard is definitely not something you should expect to find with your keyboard.Who knows, maybe they didn't read the manual and accidentally locked themselves out of their keyboard haha.Features: 10/10Ergonomics: Initial Use - 6/10, Later Use - 9/10Build Quality: 10/10 (so far still holding up with no issues whatsoever over a year later of constant usage)Portability: 10/10Would Recommend: 13.5/10",true,1,16,"115","B082FTSMNP","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,94.99,"USD",0,0,0,51,3.9,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082FTSMNP","198.90",false,false,false,false,"iKBC Typemaster X410 White Backlit LED Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Low Profile Red Switch for Windows/Mac, Full Siz...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FSVQ1JkxL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

To many times have I gone from one video with super quiet audio to another that wants to blow my speakers. Having an audio dial that accessible is the solution I needed.Cons:I have at least three key switches that are causing issues after 3 months.The tab key either doesn't work at all or ""bounces"" (detects multiple triggers when only struck once) and sends multiple tab keys. As someone who uses tab to move between fields when filling forms and auto completing text, this has become quite a nuisance. Autocomplete in gmail has turned into auto-send an email before I'm done typing it.the shift key (and yes that non-capital at the beginning of this sentence is the issue) fails to work about one in ten times. Half the time I catch it and go back and have to fix it - slowing me down.The ""j"" key is super sensitive meaning if I brush it when putting my hands on the keyboard or while typing around it, I end up with a random j in the middle of the page.In short, I can't recomjmend this keyboard.

Enter the iKBC cherry mx red tkl keyboard. Even after using mechanical keyboards for almost a year now, I still prefer thesatisfying tactile feedback of brown switches, nonetheless, the typing experience on the iKBC takes a little getting used to if you are coming from more traditional keyboards. The 3 biggest differences for me were the height of the keyboard (very comfortable without a wrist rest), the size of the keys (they look like they have been squashed down by Wreck it Ralph) and the unique sizing of the spacebar, enter and backspace keys. The keycaps are not that great and have no texture on top. They are quite smooth and if you have any moisture on your fingers, it will show a glossy reflection on the caps. This keyboard is so silent, especially for a mechanical keyboard! and It comes with a volume wheel. This is the only reason I spend an extra $25 on this keyboard over another low-profile tkl that uses a micro usb connection.

Odd S/N.","The keyboard itself has been incredible, which is why I left 3 stars, more on that soon.When it arrived, I was extremely excited to open its brand new packaging and most likely rate it 5 stars.However, it arrived with tamper stickers that definitely looked like the package had been opened at least once, and the manual listed on the box was missing. As a lesser concern, the serial number also didn't look anything like those listed in their website's software downloads.Opened tamper seals and not receiving everything listed on the box are generally huge red flags to me, which tend to be signs of refurbished items. Aside from that, it just seems like a product at full price should come in professional packaging with all the promised parts. If things have changed from what the packaging indicates, they could at least add a sticker stating that new products will have opened seals and missing manuals. For now, I'm not sure if my product is refurbished or used even though I payed full price.The keyboard itself works extremely well, and the brown switches feel wonderful to type on. The spacebar has a very light chirp when pressed, and I'm not sure if that's a sign of a refurbished item with a quirk in the stabilizer or if it's normal. However, it's barely noticeable and probably wouldn'taffect the review stars if I were certain it arrived brand new. There has been no key chatter, the keys feel very stable and crisp, and the build quality has been fantastic. The LEDs and the software have worked in a stable manner, even though it required downloading the ""other"" version of the GMMK software on their site, because the serial is very different from any of the mentioned ones. The small size of the TKL model feels much nicer than I expected it to and leaves a lot of desk space free compared to my old Razer BlackWidow.The product probably would have easily gotten 5/5, but it's unclear whether it's new and I'm not interested in refurbished products at full price even if they've only been touched once by a different owner, wearing gloves. There's a reason I purchase things new at full price.However, I refuse to deal with shipping hassles even if it's refurbished, and I also don't want to go without this type of keyboard while waiting for another, so it seems stuck here either way.It's a fantastic keyboard and I'd like to be certain it arrived brand new and not refurbished.

"R2QIY91B3IF6V8","Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2021",5,"I love this keyboard.It isn't perfect, but I would certainly buy it again.","Reviewing the Glorious GMMK TKL (87 key) RGB model, black version, bought populated (not bare bones) through Amazon. The board is for my own use, I am not a paid reviewer. This is my third mechanical keyboard, and is by far the best of the three (vs Corsair & Rantopad).The keyboard feels solid and well-built. I have only had the board a few weeks so cannot comment on reliability. One reviewer mentioned ESD susceptibility in winter, so I plan to take ESD precautions in dry weather.Regarding the furnished keycaps, the translucent letters do not diffuse light as much as you'd think, so the lighting is considerably brighter when I sit up above the keyboard than it is if I slouch. This may be different if you use different keycaps. The keycap font is odd, but to me only a few keys are actually annoying:&, 8, 0, O, D and B.I can live with this for the time being; maybe in a year or so I will get new keycaps but I am not in a hurry.The RGB lighting is good, with only minor light bleed around the keys. If you want lots of light shining around the keys, buy a set of ""pudding"" keycaps (offered with the bare-bones version) that have clear surrounds; but personally I would find this distracting. But my keyboard sits next to a large north-facing window, lots of ambient light, and the keys are plenty bright for me.The stock Gateron Brown switches are very smooth, more smooth than their namesake Cherry MX Browns which feel scratchy to me. But in exchange for the smooth feel they are not very tactile, and pretty light (48 grams tactile peak, 36 grams at actuation and 52 grams to bottom).I am fine with this, but some people might want switches that are stiffer, perhaps more tactile, or perhaps clicky. If so, consider buying the bare-bones version of the board and adding the preferred switches separately.I am happy with the stock brown switches. I put some stiffer, clicky switches (Gateron green) in just a few places like caps lock and the windows & menu keys where I want to feel & hear when I've accidentally pressed one. Sawpping the switches out was easy.The software to set up custom key colors is OK but not well documented. I have had some problems with color profiles disappearing when the computer is restarted. Helpful hint: the ""Apply"" button doesn't acknowledge when you click it, but click it anyway. Otherwise the profile you've been working on may not be saved. Also be sure to close edit mode on one profile before opening another (you can have three profiles).PROS:>Well-built, quiet board>My connector is USB-C (I have the TKL 87-key board, bought August 2021)>Per-key RGB lighting with ability to switch between 3 custom lighting profiles>Can change switches without soldering / unsoldering – I have done this and it is easy>Can be purchased as bare-bones, allowing separate choice of switches and keycapsCONS:>USB-C connector fits rather loose and is easily bumped.>Software to program per-key colors has issues with save & restore, if you do subtle colors that aren't in the furnished 48-color palette you may need to write down RGB values and re-enter them.>The lighting is bright when viewed from above, but it is rather directional so it looks less bright (bu still bright enough) if I slouch back in my chair. Keycaps with more diffusive windows might help this.",true,1,17,"116","B071KGHZY4","keyboard IKBC CD108",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,1270,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071KGHZY4","5969.00",false,false,false,false,"Glorious GMMK Modular Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - TENKEYLESS (87 Key) - RGB LED Backlit, Brown Switches, Hot Swap Switche...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fRiLZccdL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
