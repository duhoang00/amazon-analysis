Well, seeing reviews and knowing some people using this I decided to get it, so I got it and I can say that it's nice, but I like the G702 a lot better.My biggest grip, and this is what seems to be just on the one I got, but the textured covering over the weights is dragging on the mouse pad, which means that the skatez on this mouse are too short. It's an easy fix to just go out and buy new skatez, but, for a new product, I should have to just yet.Other things I am not a fan of is this mouse is good for smaller hands, I feel. Also, the definition between the buttons are not very defined, and I feel you can easily click the wrong button.

"R35F488ZTHZZSA","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"How do gaming mice this bad even exist?","At first this seemed like a decent gaming mouse to use until I got the Glorious Model O Wireless, (check out all Glorious mice, they're much better than this and have a similar design!) but it was flaming garbage. I play a lot of minecraft 1.8.9 which has spam clicking combat and you need pretty high cps to last with many other factors, and I butterfly click, which is putting the pads of your index and middle fingers on one mouse button and rotating them up and down one finger at a time, and on my main mouse which is a cheap lenovo office mouse i got from my teacher for free, i can get up to 17 clicks per second. Butterfly clicking relies on double clicking, and this mouse doesn't double click, which I suppose is a good thing, butI can't click fast at all on it. Since jitter clicking doesnt rely on doubleclicks, I think a good jitter clicker could get like 14 cps on this thing but i dont jitter click because it hurts my arm and you can also get early carpel tunnel. As far as I remember with my experience on this thing, my max cps was 10, VERY VERY RARELY. The sensor also had lots of delay sometimes. Whenever i spun my mouse was when I most realized it. It has bad feet which scratch against your mousepad, but decent dpi and decent rgb lights. Another bad thing is that the macro side buttons arent very sturdy, but very soft instead, and not clicky enough so you can easily press one of them without meaning to and mess yourself up in some games. Also, the LED lights don't have the exact color they have on the amazon thumbnail of this product. Also, I have a personal preference for symmetrical mice, and this one isn't symmetrical, but you can't notice that and it doesn't affect my review. I try drag clicking on this mouse sometimes, which is using friction to drag your finger on a mouse button and get over 50 cps on quality mice by good drag clickers, but this mouse only picks up 1 click. This is a very good mouse for every day use as it still looks pretty sick, but this is NOT a gaming mouse. One more thing. If it had a mouse software to adjust the debounce time and possibly get a high cps, i might consider using this mouse. But it doesn't have a software at all. I spent an hour of my life searching for one when i bought this. Please stick to a more well known brand for gaming materials such as Glorious, Razor, Redragon, or Logitech unless you want to be scammed like me. I'm getting my Glorious Model O Wireless next week, and as my friend only wants an rgb mouse I'm going to be giving this one to him. I do think the model o wireless looks cooler though. At least my efforts won't be for nothing. I don't even play other games with this mouse and never have, as I play minecraft mostly. However, I have seen some reviews on this mouse and only 1 good review by an infamous youtuber who seemed to only like this mouse for its rgb, color, and charging mechanics, as his old mouse ran on batteries, and i'm pretty sure this was before heavy use. It would be better to get a good gaming mouse from a more well-known or popular budget gaming brand.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,14,"114","B093LSMKL3","logitech g 502 hero kda",true,49.99,"USD",59.99,10,16.67,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093LSMKL3","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 5 Gaming Mouse with PrismSync RGB Lighting and 9 Programmable Buttons – FPS, MOBA, MMO, Battle Royale – ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61QdKZP26rS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.
