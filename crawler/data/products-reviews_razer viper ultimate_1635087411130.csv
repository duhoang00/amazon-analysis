"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

So I went for this G604.It feels great in my hand, cradles my thumb perfectly and the buttons are all accessible for my tiny lady hands. Excellent design!But... The Ghub software?

This mouse has been stress-tested by the best in the tech. industry and Logitech weren't lying, this mouse is FAST.

It has this elegance that isn't the embarrassing ""gamer"" stylings of other products but isn't so minimalistic that you wouldn't immediately recognize this mouse at first glance. Anybody who's ever used this mouse knows exactly what this feels and looks like.Is this mouse necessary? Absolutely not. I think the only thing more over-the-top than this mouse is the amount of R&D and feedback Logitech went through to create one of the best mice in PC gaming. I do prefer the Razer Viper Ultimate over this because I prefer the texture and shape. I am also bothered that a $150 computer mouse looks almost too simple. Also, in my opinion, the Viper Ultimate doesn't feel that much heavier than this. I wanted to note that, in case anybody wanted a cheaper alternative.Overall, this mouse is a flex, or for anybody who wants to go out of their way to spend time and money on their gaming hobby (gaming career maybe?).

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse.

Their service is better than Amazon, so please buy the product without any worries of amazon potentially failing you.Review of the mouse itself:The mouse hits all the important points that modern mice these days need. It is lightweight yet still has a sturdy build, excellent feeling clicks, and a coating that is easy on the hands. The shape is the old school intellimouse shape, with slight adjustments to make it even more comfortable for smaller/medium size hands.My only gripe about the mouse is the sensor - a PAW3335 which is known to have issues - but the implementation was great on this mouse.

"R3NGDI5C3VV8QO","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"TERRIBLE. Scroll Wheel WILL Start to Squeak and Fail After 3 Months.","For the first few months, it was good. Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches. It's the most frustrating thing I've experienced with a mouse and I've finally given up and am purchasing a different one.

Great if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate.","When compared to the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate , after 1 week of use:TLDR - Scroll wheel and LED upgrades are good.But... the +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. No way to adjust resistance. I really wish they had kept that feature.Some people wont like the change to the weight, but I wont mind it.With all that said, if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate, you'll be happy with this mouse.",true,1,15,"115","B09C13PZX7","razer viper ultimate",false,69.99,"USD",0,0,0,70,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C13PZX7","315.00",false,false,false,false,"Razer Basilisk V3 Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse: Fastest Gaming Mouse Switch - Chroma RGB Lighting - 26K DPI Optical...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JKqNxaZkL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The Basilisk's shape isn't as comfortable for my hands as that mouse, mainly because it's lacking a little in size compared to the MX. This mouse is much nicer for gaming though as there are more DPI options, and honestly the clicks seem a little more responsive for gaming.The software control for this mouse is good, but I feel it's not as responsive as the wired Basilisk V2 that I had was. This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly. Honestly, I think V2 looks a little bit more classy because it's not leaving an RGB shadow behind by default.Still I think the V3 is overall a better upgrade over the V2 because of the infinite scroll wheel.
