"R37NEA2RQ5YJM9","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2021",5,"Low profile high performance mouse surface","I bought this to replace an 8-year-old Razer Sphex skin, which was almost identical other than the size and design. The Sphex was being used on the tiny computer desk in our family room. I like having a low profile mouse pad on that desk which doesn't stick out. The Sphex did well considering how much use it got, and how my daughter liked to lift up the edges and crease them with her nails during online class until tiny pieces eventually tore up bit by bit.I like the design of these pads. The Sphex was accurately called a desktop skin, which is what it is. This new one's called 'thin mouse pad', which can be misleading. It's basically a piece of plastic that's smooth and tacky on one side (to stay in place), and textured on the other side to give good mouse performance. This new version has a cloth 'tag' that you can use to pull it up and reposition it. These are very easy to reposition, but only as long as you keep the tacky side off the table as little as possible so it doesn't collect dust, and make sure any surface you move it to is cleaned thoroughly. You also have to be careful not to crease it, since any crease on this material is permanent and will always show. For all these reasons, this is NOT appropriate as a travel mouse pad.I was initially worried that the design on this would be too bright, but the actual mousepad has more muted colors than in the pictures. Overall I highly recommend it.",true,1,1,"10","B01N9QKU2S","razer sphex v2",true,11.99,"USD",14.99,3,20.01,8364,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9QKU2S","36801.60",false,true,false,false,"Razer Sphex V2 Gaming Mouse Pad: Ultra-Thin Form Factor - Optimized Gaming Surface - Polycarbonate Finish","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71wvjUf7tcL._AC_UL320_.jpg"

"R28KEZH77S4MSX","Reviewed in Italy on October 14, 2021",,"Razer Sphex V2: antiscivolo e super veloce!","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. ✔️ È antiscivolo!Inizio da qui perché ero titubante sull'acquisto leggendo le altre recensioni. Il tappetino arriva con una pellicola super sottile e super trasparente applicata sul retro. Sembra che non ci sia! Per notarla e rimuoverla correttamente, bisogna guardare attentamente nel punto che ho indicato nella foto: vicino la linguetta Razer. Se non rimuoverete la pellicola che protegge lo strato antiscivolo, ovviamente il tappetino non sarà antiscivolo.Una volta rimossa, basterà pulire bene la superficie della scrivania, posare il tappetino e questo non si schioderà più (come si può vedere in video, dove scuoto la scrivania ma il tappetino non cede di 1mm!). Naturalmente è possibile sollevarlo intenzionalmente, sempre attraverso la linguetta Razer (non è adesivo!).✔️ Super veloce!A me piacciono i micro movimenti. Sono abituato da tanti anni a usare la massima sensibilità sui mouse proprio per muovere il meno possibile il polso. Per lo stesso motivo sono abituatissimo ai mini tappetini. La texture di questo tappetino è straordinaria. Sembra di poter far scorrere il mouse semplicemente soffiando.❗ Occhio ai piedini!La scorrevolezza dei tappetini duri si paga con un consumo più rapido dei piedini del mouse.Se giocate a sparatutto e, in generale, a titoli che richiedono precisione, vi serve attrito e quindi un tappetino morbido.

The experience has been overall very good.Where it lacks is durability of the cloth skin on the mat. The right hand side (see pic) shows noticeable wear after less than a year of use. This was a disappointment, because if not for that fact I would have given this a no-fault review. A less important nitpick: The single channel EL strip, vs a multi-channel zone strip like what the Firefly uses to produce the wave effect. A mat this large would show off greatly if the EL strip could handle it, IMO.Pictures show a.) the spot on the mat where it's taken notable wear and tear, discoloring and fraying the fabric skin of the mat; and b.) a snapshot of my Goliathus workspace: From left to right: The Razer Charging Pad Chroma, the Blackwidow Chroma v2; the Mouse Dock Chroma; and the Naga Pro.

There are a few of caveats to this mouse pad:1) The big aluminum backing plate interferes with wireless. I moved my wireless receiver to the USB port on the side of my monitor so it's basically line of sight, but before that I had it in the back of my tower (where it worked with a simple plastic mouse pad) and experienced very inconsistent behavior.2) Hard plastic grabs mouse skate material - you will need to replace your skates from time to time. This also means cleaning your mouse pad regularly.3) I cannot find an OEM replacement for the plastic, and I'm already wearing smooth spots on it. I'm sure I can source a 3rd party sheet of plastic and cut a bunch out on the water jet at work, but that's not practical for most users.

"RWQ9CAALUOHXD","Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2021",5,"Better get one now. Here's why.","High-quality aluminum mats are the slickest, they glide like no other pad/mat every made. The only two (high-quality) aluminum mats ever made were this one and the Steelseries SX. BOTH are long out of production. You won't find a NIB Steelseries SX anywhere on Earth; personally I liked it more than the Manticor … but again, they are techno-history now.So here you are. This is the last of the new old stock for these Manticors. So grab one while you still can.Ok, it (and the SX) at $50, that's pretty pricey. Especially when you see $15 no-name aluminum mats all over Amazon. But if you read the reviews for all those no-names, you will see a lot of complaints – they don't last long, the finish is paint instead of anodized, they are rough-ridin' and so on. That's was never true about the SX or the Manticor. My SX only gave up the slick, taking on some chips and with a serious loss of finish, after about 14 years. And I have one Manticor that is six years old; it's taken one barely visible 3mm water stain and still rides 110% slick. So, on a cost-per-year basis, you come out sweet on the Manticor.So again, if you want the quickest, slickest ride for your mouse, better get one of (the last of) these while you can.Disclaimer: To get all the slick & quick I can, I also put strips ofCS Hyde Teflon Mouse Tape (click here)over my mice feet … and I also spritz & wipe the Manticor with a bit ofDuPont Silicone Teflon Lubricant Aerosol Spray (click here).",true,1,23,"122","B00B829UQY","razer sphex v2",false,49.99,"USD",0,0,0,157,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00B829UQY","690.80",false,false,false,false,"Razer Manticor: Optimized Tracking Surface - Aircraft Grade Aluminum Material - Microscopic Texture - Gaming Mouse Pad","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31PyfNwRz1L._AC_UL320_.jpg"
