The Bluetooth seems to work well with Macs. If you are planning on gaming with them then go pick up a cheaper pair of something because you cannot have nice audio (speakers) & voice-chat (headset) at the same time due to the way the codecs are setup for Bluetooth. Also Windows Bluetooth (tried multiple adapters and built-in BT) will randomly drop the connection.

"R7OWJHZ5SMBBB","Reviewed in Spain on September 23, 2021",,"BONITO DISEÑO. BUEN SONIDO","The media could not be loaded. 7️⃣ VALORACIÓNEn muchos de las reviews que hay de auriculares, estos modelos son los que más valoraciones positivas consiguen. Hablamos de una gama media de auriculares por menos de 100€Todos estos modelos cuenta con un bonito diseño y buena calidad de sonido, por lo que la diferencia entre ellosse base en pequeños matices o accesorios incluidos.En el caso de estos auriculares SteelSeries Arctis 3, estamos ante unos auriculares con etiqueta gaming, pero con un diseño elegante y de calidad.Lo que más destacaría de este modelo es su comodidad junto a con su calidad de sonido, aunque bajo mi punto de vista, está un poco por debajo que el Logitech G PRO o el HyperX Cloud Alpha Pro. La diferencia eneste modelo, es que NO viene con la tarjeta de sonido USB incluida.En cuanto a su comodidad, la diadema es de plástico duro y tiene una goma que es la que se adapta a tu cabeza. Esta goma es ajustable. Las orejeras, con de espuma, muy cómodas lo que los hace unos auriculares realmente agradables.Cualquiera de los otros modelos de auriculares presentan una gran comodidad, si bien, el Logitech G PRO y el modelo de HyperX Cloud Alpha Pro puede que tenga una presión en los laterales, un poco más acentuada. Para mi no es algo muy significativo ya que no noto gran diferencia, pero puede que alguien que por ejemplo use gafas, puede fijarse más en estos detalles.Yo buscaba unos auriculares que tuviesen el micro y el cable de audio extraíble y que pudiese encontrar fácilmente repuestos. Estos auriculares cuentan con dos conexiones jack 3.5mm en un auricular, sin embargo, el micrófono NO es extraible, sino que es retráctil, se oculta dentro de al auricular izquierdo.Tiene un control de volumen lo tienes en el propio auricular, a diferencia de otros modelos, que tienen el control en el propio cable.✅ CONCLUSIÓNUnos auriculares con un relación calidad/precio justa. Unos auriculares gaming a buen precio.

Its wireless.Ok the negatives. To maximise the headphones capabilities you need to manipulate how loud certain frequencies are at otherwise the sound will just not be as optimal. Songs will have less impact, audio from movies, TV shows feels flat. Then we have the actual application the Steel Series engine 3. My god what a mess... Anytime a headset needs an additional program feels like an incomplete product. I get it if people who are more well versed in headphones will enjoy tinkering with the details but the system just didn't work. So much trial and error just to get feedback on the microphone because the ""noise cancelling"" part of the headphones literally makes me feel like my head is being crushed.""DTS Headphone:X v2.0 Surround for PC"" Yea ok buddy, I tested surround sound with a headset that did have surround sound and tried it on a YouTube video that had capabilities for surround. Did not work for Arctis 7. Everything at the same volume no panning to either side. If you're buying this as a ""gaming headset"" look elsewhere.Look there are almost 0 reason to actually go for wireless headset besides the fact that it has no wires. Sure you could go to your bathroom while having it on but that really is it. Nice battery life I still have to charge the damn thing. Basically you still have a cord but you can occasinally take it off and still hear you sick beats woohoo.TL:DR: Its a very average wireless headset, there's no surround sound so don't bother with fps games with this headset, you are basically putting yourself at an disadvantage.

"R3FC9M96NF0FDD","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021",5,"Working well","Mice are like shoes, so it's difficult to say what works well for everyone. I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times.

"R2G6KZBNQB91IZ","Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2021",4,"Versatile Bluetooth Wireless Gaming Headset","I've had these this headset since about March/April 2020.I think most of the reviews I've read online covered them well.And they are correct is they are very versatile in their use.I've used them on my mobilephone (Android), PC, Ocuulus Quest 2 and PS4.Given what they are, they're not going to satisfy an audiophile.Probably not the best for very competitive gaming.The sound is solid.It is true that the volume is lower when using Bluetooh versus wired.A little disappointing.They're are not able to use Steelseries game audio engine.I never tried it when they could, so I cannot comment how much of difference they make.I do use them a lot of Zoom sessions and they work well.The one issue I have is that the earcoushins seem to absorb my sweat and head oils.They don't really get a stink, but can leave a residue on the desk or paper.The ear coushins are removable so they can be washed.They don't do great well in the clothes washer.They ring that keeps the coushin oval, tends to break.To be safe, either wash by hand or the dish washer.The ear coushins can be replaced--Steelseries or third party makers.The wired cord is about four feet long.This works fine for many situations such as the desk or connecting to gaming controller such as the PS4.I found it a little short and wasn't able to leave my desk.There are third party companies that make longer ones.I brought a small one for use the the Oculus Quest 2.I have considered some of their higher end Steelseries with Bluetooth, but this is the only one without needing to use a Bluetooth adapter, which means cannot easily use with mobile games.I assume at some point this will change as the games on that platform get more advance.I think these are excellent value at $100 or less in that they can be used across multiple platforms.It would be nice if the next version could be paired with multiple devices so they don't have to repaired when switching devices.",true,1,19,"120","B07GTVK5W3","steelseries arctis",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,2399,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GTVK5W3","10315.70",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Arctis 3 Bluetooth - Wired Gaming Headset + Bluetooth - For Nintendo Switch, PC, PS5/PS4, Xbox Series X|S|One,...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61kCNUwhVAL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2NZR693TI2X91","Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2021",4,"THIS HEADSET IS AIMBOT. I'd buy again. One year later.","These are not Bluetooth. They are USB dongle wireless. The dongle is usb-c so it can be used with smartphones. I have it connected to a normal USB adapter to connect to my system. I used it for months with PS4 before purchasing a PS5. Works fine on both systems. It comes with a wired cord so there's an input for wired connectivity as well.On a full charge I'm able to game all day. I'd say around 12 hours at least. I like that it has a beeping indicator that let's you know when the battery is low. I've got through an entire 30 min warzone match before it died post notification. Exceptional battery life.This headset can be louder than it needs to be. I hear footsteps that my friends don't. I think they use cheap turtle beach or dollar store headsets. Whenever I'm spectating them in warzone I call out guys they SWEAR they don't hear. THIS HEADSET IS AIMBOT.I've recorded my games and listened to myself and the mic is super exceptional. Teammates have no issues hearing me. And at least while running it wirelessly, teammates don't hear their voice feedback while communicating. I think it has that feedback issue while running wired. Haven't tested that on PS5. I wouldn't run wired while gaming with friends but if you're playing solo it should be fine.My only gripe about this headset is the build quality. The headrest cushion is slightly detaching so it snags my ""pretty black boy blonde hair"" when I remove the headset as seen in pictures I provided. Praying it doesn't leave me bald overtime. This happened 2-3 months in of owning the headset. Possibly sooner. It's not an absolute deal breaker for me. I should probably super glue it back. However because of that, I'll be giving it 4 of 5 stars.If you want AIMBOT, if you want a wireless headset, if you want to hear all the footsteps in COD this headset is for you. If you don't want your hair snagged when removing... Don't get this headset. But that issue could possibly be fixed with super glue. I've used this headset for a full year.

"R2A5DT4VLNUN19","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"Newer Version is TRASH; Don't Buy","The first legitimate headset I ever bought for PC gaming was the HyperX Cloud II (back in ~2015). Even when the mic stopped working properly, I bought mic replacements and continued using the headset because it was great. However, my headset finally began breaking and I've lost audio in one ear. Rather than try something new, I opted to continue with the tried and true Cloud II.The new headset is definitely a newer version of the Cloud II and it is utter TRASH. The audio is terrible and the noise-cancelling is bad in the sense that I can't hear myself talking enough and it actually makes it difficult to speak. The mic is also a downgrade from its original version. The USB dongle you can plug into has removed the backlight and I initially thought it was broken/inoperable before I realized they removed the light. Personal preference, but an annoying change.There are much better headsets out there; choose something else. I'm terribly disappointed in how the Cloud II has changed since the first time I purchased it.",true,1,22,"123","B00SAYCXWG","steelseries arctis",true,79.99,"USD",99.99,20,20,22068,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SAYCXWG","101512.80",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - HyperX Cloud II - Gaming Headset, 7.1 Surround Sound, Memory Foam Ear Pads, Durable Aluminum Frame, Detacha...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71g5MRbP52L._AC_UY218_.jpg"
