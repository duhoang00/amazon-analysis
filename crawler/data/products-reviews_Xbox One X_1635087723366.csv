"RLLDRBDTVM3QA","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",5,"Awesome value, great for small hands, *won't* be keeping","First, I have to commend Victrix on the really, really aggressive pricing for this controller. As of writing (Oct. 2021), you get trigger locks, four (or two) paddles, two faceplates, solid build quality, and fine adjustments via app for just $100, which is WILD in a market dominated by $180-200 options or even higher! $100 is a statement, for sure. I really hope this gives ""big controller"" a run for its money. I would love to see folks like Razer forced to actually look at their designs instead of using the same uncomfortable paddles since 2017. Heck, maybe it'll push Microsoft to add a third set of triggers (Razer M1/M2 style) to an Elite Series 3!Anyway, I love almost everything about this controller. Buttons are clicky and very responsive, I love having five different positions I could lock the triggers to, and the shape feels very ergonomic in a way some elite controllers don't quite nail. I even grew to love the purple/white aesthetic. It's a looker and it's clear a lot of thought and care was put into this pad.Honestly, for the value proposition and feature set, you can't beat the Gambit. That said, **extremely nerdy nitpicks incoming**This won't unseat my Elite Series 2 as my daily driver, for a few reasons.1) I love the idea of the back paddles being flush with the grips, but in practice, it ends up feeling a bit ""cramped"" back there. Maybe this won't be an issue for smaller hands, but keeping my middle finger and ring finger positioned on both paddles means the fingers are basically pressed together, which isn't a natural, comfortable grip.2) Having to ""squeeze"" my fingers to actuate those back buttons moves the controller slightly every time. In fast-paced FPS games, I felt this was throwing off my aim a bit. The Elite Series 2 doesn't ""jitter"" when you use the paddles, probably because they're a bit detached from the unit itself.3) Maybe it's an issue with my particular unit, but the purple silicone ""Match Silencer"" faceplate is just different enough sized from the white plastic plate to cause issues. We're probably talking nanometers, but it's enough where my left analog stick can't reach its 100% full tilt in a few places. My movement felt a bit slow in-game, so I checked out the Victrix Control Hub app for calibration, and I couldn't complete the ""rotate your analog sticks"" test because it wasn't *quite* seeing the full, complete rotational movement.",true,1,12,"112","B08FCV5YSS","Xbox One X",false,99.99,"USD",0,0,0,4,3.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FCV5YSS","14.40",false,false,false,false,"Victrix Gambit World's Fastest Xbox Controller, Elite Esports Design with Swappable Pro Thumbbsticks, Custom Paddles, Swap...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71V-e6KNgoL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R3B6V8CATQDKQ4","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2021",3,"Overall good gameplay but bugs and confussion abound","UPDATE: There are three things a seasoned Far Cry Player likes to do: Scout a target to see where all the soldiers and alarms are , be able to quickly change weapons as needed, understand the current objective.I have put this game away for the time being because so many of the missions are ill defined and enemies keep coming even when you turn off all the alarms. Down one helicopter using all your ammo and another shows up. Shoot everything in sight, allies even show up as if you are about to capture the area, then more soldiers materialize out of thin air. So much for scouting and planning!! It is unclear whether you are to accomplish a small objective and run away or capture the area. I would rather play when it is fixed, if ever, I say that because after the last update yet another big problem...The weapons wheel is malfunctioning.At first I thought my controller had gone bad, but I added a brand new wired controller and the same thing happened. First the wheel is hard to generate and may blink off. Then you are frozen on your current weapon and can't move the wheel. Next the weapon isn't really chosen and the wheel stays up, blocking whatever is shooting at you. You have to click the right control button to make it go away. But you still have the issue of not changing the weapon. So you might be fighting a helicopter with a hand gun. It makes the game unplayable.Old review below.....This could be a glitch in the xbox one version but there are a lot of retrieval and inventory issues.Could not kick in the boards on the bunker to get my first supplies. After capturing the first fort and spending a lot of time looking for and finding the armory key, I arrived at the door only to find the key missing from inventory. I went back to make sure I had taken it and i had.Once you leave the small island you've fled to and return to the main there are other issues. Checkpoints are easy to claim, but if you enjoy taking out alarm systems on forts without being detected, then removing the guards to claim the area, that doesn't seem to work anymore. Enemies keep coming, often appearing where you just shot one. Sooner or later you get killed or run out of supplies. I don't think the game is supposed to do this. It isn't fun if it is. I tried shooting every vehicle that arrived as well and nothing changed. Wait a few moments and the enemies appear again.The next issue has to do with picking up an item and also taking to people using the x command. Standing in exactly the right spot to generate the command gets old. Trying to pick up gear ten times in a row or simply get someones attention is not fun and you begin to wonder if you are really supposed to talk to them.There may be a global fix for this that they can apply, but it doesn't affect all objects and people.",true,1,13,"113","B08CKL9K4Z","Xbox One X",false,58.85,"USD",0,0,0,59,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08CKL9K4Z","236.00",false,false,false,false,"Far Cry 6 Xbox Series X S, Xbox One Standard Edition","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81H9XVy5z8S._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Far Cry 6 looks like it will have a lot of playability since you have lots of stuff to do and lots of ways to do it.I can't complain about the game mechanics. Everything seems to have been thought through well. As is usual with the Far Cry series, you start with a small map and gradually expand your activities to bigger maps. And as you would expect from a Far Cry game, there are lots of quirky characters and you spend time capturing bases, crafting, and defeating evil characters.Every one of the games in the Far Cry series has improved on the previous game (although probably the original Far Cry was more fun than Far Cry 2 for most players).
