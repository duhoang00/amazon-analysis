The TLDR is that it's incredibly well built, fully wireless, responsive, and the lightest mouse on the market. And it's pearly white.I don't know what other relevant details I can give. This mouse has been stress-tested by the best in the tech. industry and Logitech weren't lying, this mouse is FAST. It has incredibly low latency, very good battery life (I mean...there's zero RGB lighting), and is quite possibly the safest shape a mouse can come in. If you don't consider your hands much larger or smaller than most people, it will probably be comfortable holding this mouse.The visual design is intelligent. It has this elegance that isn't the embarrassing ""gamer"" stylings of other products but isn't so minimalistic that you wouldn't immediately recognize this mouse at first glance. Anybody who's ever used this mouse knows exactly what this feels and looks like.Is this mouse necessary? Absolutely not. I think the only thing more over-the-top than this mouse is the amount of R&D and feedback Logitech went through to create one of the best mice in PC gaming. I do prefer the Razer Viper Ultimate over this because I prefer the texture and shape. I am also bothered that a $150 computer mouse looks almost too simple. Also, in my opinion, the Viper Ultimate doesn't feel that much heavier than this. I wanted to note that, in case anybody wanted a cheaper alternative.Overall, this mouse is a flex, or for anybody who wants to go out of their way to spend time and money on their gaming hobby (gaming career maybe?).

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse. If you have large hands (especially in length), I highly recommend this mouse because you can claw and fingertip this mouse comfortably, and maybe even palm grip.

El diseño es bastante bonito y, un poco mas distinto a lo ""gamer tradicional"", dado que combina blanco negro, con el diseño de KDA de League of Legends (en lo personal a mi me da igual eso, me gusta mas por el diseño).Eso si, cosas a cosas a considerar:-El cable tiene una especie de sujecion especial, puedes utilizar cualquier micro usb (si, no usa usb C) pero da la sensacion que se desconectara en algun momento.-Las keycaps no dejan una buena sensacion, se sienten un poco extrañas y puedo detectar que se van a desgastar rapido, ojo con esto. Ademas, encontrar un set de keycaps que cubra todas las teclas, es complicado, dado que las unidades de algunas teclas como el espacio (5.75u), el shift, y los ctrl, no son estandar o OEM.-El software, quizas puede generarle algunas complicaciones a algunos usuarios.En resumen:Pros:-Teclado premium en su mayoria, buena construccion.-Iluminacion bastante prominente.-Switches brown bastante comodos, no son tan ruidosos como los blue, de la version original de este teclado (g pro).-Diseño unico hasta el momento.Cons:-Keycaps un poco incomodas, con un desgaste un poco mas acelerado-Incompatibilidad con todas las keycaps estandares, dado el formato especial de logitech.-Switches no intercambiables.En mi puntuacion el dare un 7/10, debido a las limitantes que presentan las keycaps tanto para un cambio a futuro, como sus unidades especiales.",true,1,4,"15","B08W2TFZZC","logitech g pro",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,198,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08W2TFZZC","930.60",false,false,false,false,"Logitech G PRO K/DA Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Ultra-Portable Tenkeyless Design, Detachable Micro USB Cable, 16.8 Million...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b73jZMqUL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"RCEN16RSC50JU","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2021",4,"Works great with SPAD. Rotary buttons will break with use.","I have three of these FIPs. I bought them one at a time as each one broke. About a year of pretty frequent use, one of the rotary knobs (the one most used) breaks off from each FIP. I replaced the first one with the second one, the second one with the third one. It's whichever button you rotate the most that will break. The tiny plastic connection is ridiculously small and weak. Button stubs still turn with a small screwdriver, or turn with mouse on screen. But that kind of negates the feature of having ""real knobs"" on the device.I recommend planning on replacing them in about a year if you flight sim frequently. You can use the broken ones for gauges that don't require a lot of button twisting.Download/purchase SPAD. It's an interface between lots of 3rd party gauges and this device. Go look at the free sample gauges and the paid gauges. They're only a couple dollars per gauge. If you can afford 125 bucks (x3 or more) for this piece of hardware, ten bucks for a couple of software gauges is a no brainer.Despite the broken knob thing, I'm still giving it four stars. It's just fabulous to have the gauge sitting ""over there"" instead of mousing/scrolling around on screen to see the gauge. Separate gauges like this encourage the quick look/cross check that we should be doing anytime there's gauges on a machine.I wish they'd beef up the knob to rotary controller connection.

I would try a Thrustmaster but they are way overpriced, some costing as much as $300 to $500! For $30 it seems to work alright. Its a little stiffer than I'd like and it could use more programable buttons. It only has 6 on the stick and 6 on one side. There is clearly a bunch of room on the other side for another 6 buttons but for some reason Logetech decided to waste the space with the logo that will be rarely looked at when in use. The throttle is designed better than my old Attack 3 which failed a few years back. It works with Windows 10 PCs and FSX Steam/Dovetail edition supports it. Hooked it up to my PC and installed the drivers automaticaly and worked intsantly. Shipping was fast as usual. Came within 24 hours as usual with Prime items. They could have at least privacy wrapped it for shipping. It came in retail packing with no attempt at hiding the contents. Had I not been home for a while when it arrived some passerby would have probably been tempted to steal it from my doorstep.

For half the cost of what I paid long ago, it’s okay - but the internal parts cannot possibly be the same in this newer unit and the fit/finish is mediocre.(The included pictures highlight rough/sharp pieces of plastic, and seams that don’t fit together well. I would have saved my old joystick for comparison photos if I knew these wouldn’t be the same.)The yaw/twist axis is sensitive but slightly unsettled on center, forcing me to calibrate a wider dead-zone than I would prefer to cancel it out. The other axis work fine without issue though.The trigger had a sharp plastic burr I needed to sand off. The seams on the stick itself are aligned poorly and feel uncomfortable compared to the old unit, with sharp edges in spots. Also, although not a real concern, the throttle feels almost gritty (compared to the silky smooth version I was used to).Overall it’s okay if you get one at bargain price, but I’d personally pay more for a version built like they used to be.

"R3U6IINMVV5SWR","Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2021",5,"Works perfect with MSFS 2020","I did not even download the Logitec drivers, but used (Payware) Spad.Next instead. Spad.Next was designed for these Logitech panels (they used to be branded Saitek before Logitech purchased that company).Spad lets you assign any command whatsoever to this panel (also the Radio Panel and the Switch Panel). You can see how versatile Spad is by watching Youtube videos by vadermike777.You can see how to use Spad.Next with Logitech panels by watching Les O'Reilly videos on Youtube. Les calls them for exapmple: (Sim Video) New User #1 | SPAD.neXtWhich is #1 in the series (getting started with Logitech panels and Spad.Next).The advantage of Spad.Next is that you can change the panel functions (what each switch and knob does, or how it does it). And you can use a different profile for each plane. It will load the right profile with the plane for you. (You cannot change any panel function with the official Logitech drivers)!Example: another panel is the Logitech Switch Panel (this one is the Multi Panel). On it is a switch labeled 'Panel Light'. Except most planes don't have a panel light (lights behind the gauges). Instead they use an overhead dome light (e.g. the default Cessna 172). With Spad.Next you tell the Logitech panel to use the rocker switch labeled 'PANEL LIGHT' to turn on and off the dome light instead of the panel light. If you are running the Logitech official plugin driver then you are out of luck. You won't be able to see the gauges at night using that switch. Because you can't reprogram the panel. But you can very easily reprogram them with Spad.Next.I have 3 Logitech panels: Switch Panel, Multi Panel, Radio Panel. They join together with thumb screws (stacked on top each other, but they have could have been joined together the same way side by side). They tilt back to make them easier to read. I have to lean my vertical stack against something because of that backward tilt (to hold them up). I use the elevation desk stand that my 32"" monitor sits on. The Logitech panel stack just leans back against that stand which hold them very steady.Five Stars!",true,1,9,"110","B01LWRNBI0","logitech g pro",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,549,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LWRNBI0","2415.60",false,false,false,false,"Logitech G Pro Flight Multi Panel","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GVAEf-JZL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R35P1I8E7T278D","Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2021",4,"Great so far, but needs lubricant","So far, the joystick feels very high quality and works great. It doesn't feel plasticy or flimsy at all. The software is mostly good enough, but you're going to be googling how to make certain things work pretty often.Firstly, the joystick was nearly unusable out of the box. The metal ring that the spring pushes against was grinding and catching on the plastic ring of the base to the extent that I couldn't make any fine movements. I applied a tiny bit of chapstick (not the best, but its what I had) and the grinding decreased completely except for one spot. After a day of use, that spot has disappeared and the joystick moves as smoothly as butter. If you're having a similar issue, give it a bit of grease and play with it for a while.If you're going to install the software, you're going to have to make a few adjustments if you want to use the clutch button ( i ) and the pinkie trigger. For games like elite dangerous and war thunder, which have built in presets for this HOTAS, with the software installed, you'll need to disable clutch mode in windows and delete the pinkie trigger settings in the software. You can google how to do these; it takes about a minute to do both.While you're in the windows settings disabling clutch mode, you should also decrease the brightness of the LEDs (which you can customize to a large extent). They're excessively bright by default (as pretty much all things are), and I found just barely above zero to be pleasant.This HOTAS is definitely not without issue, and only time will tell if it lasts long, but so far I would recommend it highly.

"RHWMGNW1B74BL","Reviewed in the United States on October 13, 2021",5,"A good mechanical keyboard for those who want their experience to be ""one and done""","I have owned several mechanical keyboards over the past 3 years. Ranging from cheap crap like Red Dragon, to consumer stuff like Corsair and Razer, as well as some of the higher end custom boards like the TOFU60 and some KBDfans stuff.For the money, I think you can do SO much better. While I appreciate the RGB quality and the sheer amount of endless RGB customization the GHUB software allows you, that is about the only thing I can rate highly.Construction is not totally terrible for a board built primarily out of plastic. But it is very hollow sounding and does not have much substance to it when typing. Has a nice weight to it and the adjustable angle stands are nice and have been useful. Stabilizers are average, but definitely nothing special. Why are they STILL using MICRO USB? It literally would cost them less than $0.30 to use USB-C instead. I dont get it. Keycaps dont seem to be double shot PBT, but theyre decent quality nonetheless. Nice RGB shine through. Switches are proprietary Logitech Blue clicky switches. They are pretty meh. If you like the sound of a loud dry keypress with significant amount of travel and play, then youll like it. Otherwise, if youve used boards that have a more consistent and overall smooth feeling keypress, this will not be a treat to use.I think this keyboard is half decent for most folks who want something they can buy once and not have to think about again after that. But if you have very high standards, have used modded or custom or just better quality keyboards prior, this one will very likely not be a great experience.Personally, I went out on a limb because I finished building my latest PC much quicker than I anticipated and have since sold the TOFU60 I had and my backup board which was a Corsair. So I bought this on a whim wanting to give a GPRO product a try. However after a month of use, I am going to revert to building a good starter 60% or maybe TKL mechanical keyboard since that can be done for under 150 and overall can feel 10 times better than this GPRO. :lTLDR6/10.
