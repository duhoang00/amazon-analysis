This mouse has been stress-tested by the best in the tech. industry and Logitech weren't lying, this mouse is FAST.

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse.

Scroll wheel isn't the most comfortable, but there's nothing wrong with it. Side buttons are very thin. Stock feet are basic black teflon. Those are the shortcomings of this mouse. I personally got used to the scroll wheel and side buttons quickly and aimed confidently with this mouse. The side buttons have good clicks and decent travel. So their ridiculously thin shape alone really doesn't make them unusable. Cable is a decent paracord. Aftermarket ones are better, but this one's fine. Replaced the feet before I even used it. It uses G203/G305 skates without the sensor ring, which makes it easy to find skates. The main reason you should get it is the weight. Under 45g stock is NUTS. This combined with the narrow egg shape makes for an extremely nimble mouse. This is a mouse you get strictly for fingertip grip in shooter games. There's really no other reason to get it considering its shortcomings. I've owned like 15 or so gaming mice and would not get this for anything else. Not general use. Not other types of games. Not productivity. Absolutely a niche product.Edit, after trying more mice, I no longer believe the extreme low weight is as advantageous as what I once thought. The feet and side buttons on this mouse also don't warrant a positive review. I have dropped this to 3 stars from 4. I wouldn't use this mouse for anything other than aim trainers honestly.

The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way.

I use a mouse 14+ h/day for long days at work and then what time I can have saving the universe. I've owned about every brand, both wired and wireless. My latest venture with the SteelSeries was based off a YT vid review that just happened to play. I'd been using a Razer Viper Mini for the past year and while it was a good mouse, it's just a bit too mini for me (average size hands).I've been pleased so far with this mouse. The weight is lighter than most, which I've increasingly grown to appreciate. I don't care much for wireless mice, so this wired one was my preference. The cable is ok - no kinks and with my setup, no drag/pull as I'm moving around. I already had a SteelSeries keyboard, so the software worked without issue picking up the mouse and adjusting settings. I've never had issue with SteelSeries software before, so that's been a non-issue as well.The mouse feels pretty good and has no plastic stuck on the sides like some of SteelSeries other mice. Those glued on pieces are nothing short of a mess over time as they goop out and get on your desk/hands/mouse. This mouse is all solid and is comfortable for long usage times. Clickers work well andthe wheel was surprisingly better than I feared - not exactly smoot, not horribly bumpy.Overall, I like this mouse and for the money, feel like I got a good product for the cost. I generally go through mice every 1 to 3 years, depending on how they hold up.
