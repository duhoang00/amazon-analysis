(You can't access the ports on the right if the power cable is facing frontwards.)2) The RGB per-key lighting is beautiful BUT the secondary characters (i.e., when you hit Shift) like for the lighting, sound and even common characters like ( ) @ # $ % on the number row do not light up -- they are not backlit! The problem (via Reddit) is that the Omron switches -- which have excellent tactile feel and travel -- have center lighting only. All right, but the printed secondary characters are done in a wispy light gray which you absolutely cannot see in the dark. (This is a poor design choice here.) They should be near white -- or at least reflect the light of the keys a bit. I just couldn't use this as a developer at night -- you'll need a separate light on to write / program at night. Of course, if you are a good typist, it doesn't matter for the common characters, but for the lighting, sound and other functions you aren't likely to know them by 'muscle memory.')Otherwise, an excellent laptop, but these are two hands-on gotchas you might not notice till you try this out this system in real life.",true,1,4,"13","B07SFR748X","laptop gigabyte g5",true,1599,"USD",1899,300,15.8,212,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFR748X","890.40",false,false,false,false,"Gigabyte AERO 15 OLED Thin and Light Laptop, 15.6 Thin Bezel UHD AMOLED Panel, i7-9750H, NVIDIA GeForce GTX1660Ti,16GB RA...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51NW5PsqpuL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I’m running the Aero 15 with RTX 2060, i7 9750, and OLED screen.The screen is about as crisp as you can get and the hardware works great together. After I bought the laptop I read a few negative reviews that got me worried. Some of them spoke about the fans being loud. Yes the fans will ramp up while gaming but it’s not a bad thing if you want cool hardware. I’ve heard no “coil whining” and had no issues with the WiFi. If you have issues with this computer it can most likely be fixed by tweaking the firmware and downloading drivers. If you are not at all tech savvy but still want to buy this computer because of the quality the first thing I would do is take it to a friend or someone that can find all the drivers for you and make all the adjustments needed to get this thing working to it’s potential, because once it’s optimized there’s no stopping it. Everything about this laptop screams “Cool”. From the way it runs, to the looks of the screen, the keyboard, and the logo on the back of the screen. The placement of the camera isn’t an issue if you don’t care about the views from your webcam, which I don’t. As far as gaming goes, I’ve run COD Black Ops Cold War (Multiplayer and Main Story) and No Mans Sky, both of which have worked great. May have to lower the video settings in the game itself to get the FPS up but it’s possible to run games at 70 FPS.

Division 2 averaged over 120 fps at max settings at 1080p. I tested war thunder, escape from tarkov andmordhau as well and both were extremely smooth (both hit 144hz reliably at ultra 1080p). No noticable input or screen lag in mordhau so fast shooterswill benefit as well.• No noticeable micro stutters when switching from• The laptop top doesn’t feel hot under pressure but I wouldn’t play this on my lap.• I added a 1tb WD Blue NVMe stick to this laptop, its easy to do and there are videos of how to do it.• The GPU runs cool for a laptop (avg 78 under pressure) but the CPU doesn’t. You can fix this by limiting the max power in power settings for the CPU or undervolting it. The cpu has initial spikes in temp but usually ends up in the mid 80s which is a little hot but expected.• Use dragon center to tune the performance. Don’t run extreme performance without cooler boost.• Buy a cooling pad and watch temps for the CPU, the CPU is the only thing that holds this beast back because it tends to hit high temps (95c max from what I saw) if left at max settings.• It has 2x USB3.2and 2x USB-C so you might need to buy an usb dongle. It has a single jack for a headset so you might need to buy a splitter depending on your headset.• One HDMI only. No displayport at all which is something to consider.

"RTB9AWLRB7F9C","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",3,"Almost","I really had high hopes for this laptop but I found a couple of issues that caused me to return it. First, there was a little bit of backlight bleed on the bottom left side of the screen. While the screen was nice and there was the normal amount of IPS glow, the little white light bleeding through on the bottom left caused me some concern. Although it was not much, it was enough for me to wonder if it would get worse over time. Knowing that there have been some who have complained about screen issues, I did not want to take the chance.Second, the laptop had a few keys that had tactile issues. The #3, #4, and W were not as responsive and springy as the other keys. When I barely moved my fingers across the number row without applying pressure, I could feel that the #3 and #4 keys seemed to be off a little. It worked when typing but I could tell the difference between them and the other keys. The W key was not as bad but you could still feel the difference between it and the Q, E, A, and S. While they may have never caused any issues throughout the life of the laptop, I don't want to take that risk with a $1000+ laptop. I have seen videos and forum posts about this same model where keys are sticking and/or not responding. I did not want to send it to Lenovo for warranty service since I just bought it. Personally, I don't trust a device that has to receive warranty repairs right out of the box.

"RLL7YBBO1REME","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",2,"Too light, cheap plastic, flimsy","I gave it two stars because specs and performance are both acceptable but that’s where the good ends for me. It’s wordy but here’s the scoop: This 16” 2021 Gram is the cheapest, “plasticky” feeling laptop I’ve ever held. The specs are good, performance is good but there is zero chance of this thing lasting through anything (regardless of that phony“military tested” hogwash they claim) and to make matters even worse, there is, likely a near ZERO chance of LG standing behind it because LG is as bad as it gets when it comes to support (based on 1st hand experience). It is probably called the Gram because it weighs close enough to a gram that they can legally name it that. It feels like a $149 Chromebook. Seriously, it does! If anyone says otherwise, they aren’t being too honest. It may actually BE better than a cheap Chromebook but it surely does NOT feel like it. It feels too light, too flimsy and too cheap, IMO. This is my 2nd Gram and on the first one, the screen strangely snapped like a thin dry twig (think toothpick) and a few years later I thought I’d try LG again and this feels even MORE like a product from Toys R Us than the first one I purchased from LG a couple years back. I sent this new, even flimsier version back like I should have done with the first one and proceeded to pay the extra few bucks for a beautiful, well built, solid aluminum and perfectly weighted Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 and this gem is a keeper! Complete different league of products….period! And not too much more $$ either! What the hell was I thinking? Screw me once, shame on you….etc……Summary: If you are a fan of ridiculously light electronics or you are a fan of well assembled Fisher Price toys, the LG Gram might be a perfect choice. If a solid, premium feeling device is desirable then my recommendation is a definite pass on LG’s Gram! It just feels wrong and over priced! Especially after holding and using a Surface Laptop 4 (which also has a touch screen). The Surface Laptop 4 works, looks AND feels 100% premium and frankly, aside from decent looks and of course performance, how a laptop “feels” is important to me. That is the straight forward scoop folks….from a 30 year computer (IT) professional. P.S. So I don’t seem like a MS fanboy, there ARE other premium feeling laptops, ASUS Zenbook, HP Spectre, some Dell models and a limited few others like MacBooks but MAC OS sucks BUT their hardware is quite premium and, really sets the bar for hardware but MS hit it out of the park here!I’m just comparing with the Surface Laptop 4 because I have one and can fairly compare it with the hapless Gram.",true,1,8,"17","B08SW2RC6V","laptop gigabyte g5",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,76,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SW2RC6V","326.80",false,false,false,false,"LG LCD Laptop 16"" WGXGA (2560x1600) Ultra-Lightweight (2.6 lbs), 11th gen CORE i7, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, C Port, USB-A, HDM...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81pKId7SSYS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I upgraded to 16 GB of RAM and added a 1 TB internal SSD and the review is based on the computer after the upgrades.Pros:-The visual fidelity is outstanding. Games like Battlefield 4 and 5 run perfectly and look amazing. Forza -Horizon 4 runs amazing at high FPS around 80 to 90 on high settings.-The Windows home screen and Cortana work great since it has a built in mic and designated buttons on the keyboard. Much better usage than on a PC.-It is very lightweight and portable.-Screen has soft colors but is very crisp.-Boot times are very fast.Cons-The battery life is atrocious but who isn't gaming without plugging in first? Watching Youtube only the battery lasted unplugged around 3 hours.-The laptop gets pretty warm and the fans are loud almost instantly loading into a game. This is not a huge issue for anyone wearing headphones.-The layout of the keyboard is very tight and you will click the wrong keys at some point. Also the touchpad is in a very strange position offset to the left so you'll want to disable it and use a mouse.Overall, this is a fantastic laptop for anyone getting into gaming computing. I own a PC with a 2080ti and even still am impressed by this little computer. The budgeting option to spend $168 a month for 5 months was a no brainer to me.

It's solidly constructed, with a comfortable keyboard, good screen, feels fast despite not being high-spec. But increasingly in the last few weeks, it's had trouble holding a wi-fi connection, even when just a few feet away from the router. Doesn't matter whether it's at home or elsewhere, the same issue happens: at least a couple times an hour, it'll stop seeing the router and become completely disconnected. It takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes to see the router again and reconnect. It's not a heat issue -- this thing never gets hot -- and it's not a line of sight problem or anything like that. Moving it to another place doesn't help it see the connection again.Pretty disappointing.

"R1BS946CW9MYT7","Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2021",4,"Almost excellent laptop.","Been playing around with the 16 inch version for several weeks now. build-wise I am very pleased. The screen doesn't wobble too much and the keyboard is just lovely to use. I will say there's one potential issue, where if you put enough weight/pressure on the space left or right of the touch pad, you can get it to register as a click, but in practical use it never happened. Something to watch out for if you have massive sausage arms that lay flat on the laptop, maybe. That aside, I REALLY like the trackpad. It's been like a decade since I used a laptop pad so I was assuming a mouse would be a mandatory purchase, but not anymore. The multi-touch controls work great, and it's nice and big so I never feel like my fingers are gravitating too far into a corner to browse properly.On the software side of things I am impressed with the SSD and operating system. Once you got your user settings entered the first time around, the computer can go from the powered-off state to your home screen in like fifteen seconds. I haven't extensively tested the CPU, though I've found it can run Overwatch at low settings and 60fps with only minimal tinkering.I primarily use it for writing and the occasional google research/time waster, which it handles with ease, and I'm sure it could stream a Spotify setlise or play iTunes on top of that as well. It also didn't seem like a big deal at first, but the fingerprint scanner is so nifty to have, I have actually become spoiled on it and feel irritated when I have to type my password out on the desktop.There are some ""bloatware"" applications pre-installed that you could do without, such as McCaffee, but mostly the applications seem fine. There's the LG Virtoo app that can sync to an LG phone, which I also happen to have. Testing it...I mean, it works, you can send/receive calls through the laptop and copy over any photos you've taken, but the bluetooth connectivity would kill your phone battery with any extensive use, and the sound/mic quality on the Gram is not professional by any means. Far more useful is the simple control panel that has your power features, screen brightness and fan options at just a click away. There's also an LG-branded video editor, though given the Gram's low voltage and integrated graphics, I doubt you'd want to compile any 4k footage on this laptop.There's only a handful of nitpicks bring it down to a 4/5. Main thing is, for whatever reason, I can't get it to save separate power usage/brightness settings depending on whether it's plugged in or not. This is quickly fixed by clicking the battery on the taskbar and using the hotkeys to change the screen's brightness, but it is irksome to do it EVERY single time. Secondly, if you use the Gram at a less than full charge while charging, the charger brick gets surprisingly warm. I'd say it's hot, even. Lastly, the screen is really glossy. As a cave-dwelling hermit this doesn't affect me, but I can imagine using this in an outdoor setting or coffee shop with a bunch of overhead lamps might not be the best experience.Can I recommend this absurdly expensive laptop to everyone? Well, no. It fits my niche of needing a super lightweight quiet writing device with a decent screen size, easily capable of some research googles or wasting time with very light gaming sessions. In this regard I am super satisfied. If you need something for gaming, media production or media consumption, there are cheaper, better options available.",true,1,16,"115","B08SW6BFWV","laptop gigabyte g5",true,1429.99,"USD",1699.99,270,15.88,68,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SW6BFWV","312.80",false,false,false,false,"LG LCD Laptop 16"" WQXGA (2560 x 1600) IPS LCD Display , DCI-P3 99%, 11th gen Intel core i7, Intel Xe Graphics, 16GB RAM, 1...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81y9aJKvvlS._AC_UY218_.jpg"
