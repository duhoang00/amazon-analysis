"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,1,"10","B07QX9C9WH","corsair katar",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better. So I will be going to the G502 if my planned disassembly and repair of my Glaive doesn't work.",true,1,6,"15","B07QX9C9WH","corsair katar",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,3650,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QX9C9WH","16790.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Nightsword RGB - Comfort Performance Tunable FPS/MOBA Optical Ergonomic Gaming Mouse with Backlit R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61a0KNfNNNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

However, I am already having issues with this mouse giving the double click issue as well, this time with the right mouse button. I've had this one for even less time than the previous. For something that costs 80 dollars this really isn't acceptable and I will be switching to a different brand for my next one.Also, iCue is the worst software package I have ever used, and is basically required to get any sort of functionality out of the mmo buttons on the side.The Logitech mmo mouse (G600) while not looking nearly as attractive lasted me for about 5 years before I finally gave it to a friend after picking up my first Scimitar. He's still using that mouse. It also comes in at half the price and has a ""better"" software setup. Not that Logi's is amazing either, but it's far better than iCue.

Going to likely and painfully return this horrible product especially after hearing this happen to others.Edit: this product is the most frustrating experience, nothing lights up properly and customer service told me I had to play email tag because their “tech support” doesn’t cover troubleshooting this and the people that do only answer by email. Sometimes 2 fans light up, other times just one but never all 3 and nothing else in the kit has ever lit up as intended. Stay away.This product comes in great packaging and you really feel like you got value for money especially when you tally up the individual items.It’s also not the cheapest, but I wanted to get something higher quality being my first time and all, but this wasn’t quite the case.To begin I learned the pipes were called something that’s just a fancy word for acrylic, and I learned very fast that it’s not very forgiving and easy to mess up. Couple that with the types of adapters you get which pretty much commit you to hardline tubing and you are stuck either with attempting to use them (and in my case immediately messing up a tube despite watching videos prior,) or investing a lot more money to get better tubes or different adapters, but it doesn’t end there…It comes with a squeeze container for filling the pump which broke off inside just from using, that was 2 hours of draining and playing rubik’s cube trying to get out, not fun. But it doesn’t end there either…The pump is awkward as heck, if you have it all plugged in the thing doesn’t operate at full power when filling and you are stuck trying to figure out why the tubes aren’t filling, why does it gotta be like that?The directions aren’t the best, and this process was very painful, I got coolant all over my motherboard and cards despite my best intent to cover everything which yes, is part to user error but I also feel the acrylic isn’t the best use and I wish there were more options from Corsair like being able to buy a kit with soft tubing. Knowing what I do now I may have opted for a cheaper kit and gotten soft line tubing to save the headache and for more flexibility.",true,1,10,"19","B08C7NTWND","corsair katar",true,399.99,"USD",479.99,80,16.67,234,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C7NTWND","1006.20",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Hydro X Series XH303i Hardline Water Cooling kit with/incl XC7 CPU Water Block, XR5 360mm Radiator,...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ccdRKB+yL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Think about slamming your hand flat on a table, this is what it feels like to press the clickers.Something more annoying than the buttons is the failure to load.

So far, I've been able to temporarily deal with this by bending the wheel back into place with a thin piece of metal, but it's become quite annoying to deal with.

"R3L8O60668R76I","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2021",5,"A nearly perfect mouse SO FAR.","Mice are something that seem to last about a year. Going into a review, you should not really expect much more than that these days if you are a hardcore user. Bearing that in mind, there are still some huge quality differences between something like this and Corsair's Harpoon.I had a Harpoon, the cheaper version of this mouse, for about a year. It did an okay job. It has less options through iCUE, and in general it's just a lesser mouse in every way. The second Harpoon I had came broken in both wheel and Omron switches, so I decided to go back to a Sabre, which I previously abandoned due to it not lasting more than 1.5 years before.Well, I guess I am here to stay, because despite Corsair manufacturing mice to basically die in a year or two, this is so much better than a Harpoon. It has dual DPI axis settings, tons of lighting settings that the other doesn't have including more options for when you are not using iCUE, and of course it can poll up into the 8000Hz range along with much improved ergonomics.Previously, you had to manually kill the iCUE process, instead of exiting normally, to retain lighting, such as no lighting, if you didn't want the iCUE process running at all. You could not exit out of it normally, or your lighting would go right back to brightly lit rainbow default. This is fixed with their ""hardware lighting"" option, except for the three DPI markers, which you still need to kill the process to get back to your normal settings.They really need to include the DPI settings in the hardware lighting option, because some of us do not want Corsair processes running at all, and we want a no lit mouse but with the option at least of having it lit when needed. Of course you can bypass all of this and just get the unlit version I think. But they still need to make a way for the DPI lights to shut off without iCUE on, and without having to use the workaround, which does work fine anyway.From a comfort standpoint, it's also a cut above. In fact, this is probably the most comfortable mouse I have ever used. Everything seems almost perfectly suited to my hands and movements. The mouse itself is quite light but not so that you would get annoyed. It glides extremely well, and there is a calibration setting for glide sensitivity built into iCUE for their better mice. It works, and this is the first time I feel not annoyed by iCUE in ages. It has come a long way, and this mouse makes full use of it.So in reality they have made steps forward in nearly every category here. iCUE is no longer garbage, the mouse functions extremely well, and it is a massive cut above their cheaper options.That about sums it up honestly. Much improved in just about every way. The click area is the same hard plastic with coating that will probably wear away after a year or two of solid use. So keep that in mind as well. These don't last forever.

"RX050XPQS8ZBF","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2021",5,"2021 Review – CORSAIR is simply Beautiful","First, I never show my enthusiast build – because it’s like restoring an old muscle car = a masterpiece and constant work in progress. The expense and headache never end (7 years now). The exception to the rule = Corsair’s XD7 water loop system. I must come out of the shadows with this thing.If you are on a budget = stop reading right now… go to the Financial Aid office and ask for money to support your bad computer habit (cuz you are in trouble dude).Even if this ‘work of art’ fails tomorrow, I will enjoy this moment. I give THANOS credit to the engineering and designers of this pump. It makes perfect sense and saves a lot of space in an EATX case (or perhaps smaller).Along with this unit – the picture shows the Corsair XC7 RGB (CPU cold plate) and the Corsair XG7 RGB (GPU water block / cold plate). And I never thought I would be staring at my own …. for three days without blinking my eyes. (see photo)Tech Specs:> The XG7 (Rev B) is a perfect fit for my EVGA 2080 XC – which is a reference card (meaning NVIDIA gives the reference and EVGA slaps two fans and a shroud over the …..) If your card is bigger than a reference size (10.5 inches long) – then you will likely shed tears finding the correct block (sorry). The problem for many is thickness (like capacitors and extra cooling junk).> The XC7 is a perfect fit for my Intel socket LGA 1200 processor (or any other); Corsair gives you the back plate and spring-loaded screws which can be mounted to where they don’t flop around on install.Advice:Remember: this is just a water pump with pretty lights and outrageous plumbing. The rest is up to you and extensive research. I had to watch several YOUTUBE videos that didn’t teach me nothing about setting up a custom loop (good for reference only or nothing at all). Takes a bit of time…But I know one rule = buy two of everything you can’t find at WALMART or BESTBUY. I needed (12) compression fittings (which come 4 to a box). I needed (2) 90-degree fittings. I did the calculations before I started. Surprisingly, the Corsair hose and coolant (1000 ml) was enough to do the entire build (can’t waste nothing testing).Hope this helps…",true,1,20,"119","B08HSQV5NZ","corsair katar",false,154.99,"USD",0,0,0,448,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HSQV5NZ","2016.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Corsair Hydro X Series XD5 RGB Pump/Reservoir Combo - D5 PWM Pump - 330ml Reservoir - Ten Individually Addr...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Bw1KiAW8L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

With all the not so good reviews, especially about the screen, I hesitated for a long time before to buy it but when I got some money as a gift from a aunt I decided to try it.First of all, the device looks very good quality and it sticks very well to my K95. The buttons and widgets are easy to setup with iCUE and you can configure them as you like (color, size, background image, etc.). You can only set 6 buttons per screen but you can set as many screens as you want and it's easy to switch between them by swiping with your finger. I switched from a two monitors setup to a single 32"" one a year ago and I was missing very much to be able to monitor my temperatures while gaming without having to run some overlay programs. Turns out that thing does it wonderfully well.Unlike some other people said I didn't notice any increase of CPU usage after I connected it (but maybe it's because my Ryzen 5900x just doesn't feel it).About the screen, it's true that if you look at it from an angle you don't see anything anymore but... this thing is not supposed to be looked at from a 45 degree angle. It is supposed to be watched when you are in front of your keyboard and when you do that it's amazingly clear and bright. My only negative point is that the touch functionality when you press a button is not always super reactive but I realize that it works fine if you aim more toward the bottom of the screen instead of the top. In that way it works just fine.Overall, it's an expansive device but for me it worth it.
