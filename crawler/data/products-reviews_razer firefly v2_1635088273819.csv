I don't have tiny hands by any means, but this mouse is extremely awkward for me to use without accidentally hitting the first row of keys on the side. My hand simply doesn't wrap around enough of the bulk of this thing to get a good grip on only the non-button portions of the mouse. This leads to firing off skills or macros that I absolutely do not intend to use yet while just moving the mouse around; I've had to disable the first row of keys entirely to avoid this.Another problem the size presents is that it won't consistently hold down the LMB if I want to click and drag; it'll often let go prematurely because my fingertips apparently don't reach far enough forward to get the leverage it needs to keep the sensors in contact.Years ago, I had a Naga that had plates you could swap out to adjust the size appropriate to your needs, but they apparently don't make them anymore, and are going with a ""one (large) size fits all"" approach.
