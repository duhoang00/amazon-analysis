"RT1J0SNBACNSC","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"Completely useless for my target purpose (gaming)","I've had a SteelSeries Rival 310 for a couple of years now and am perfectly happy with it, but then I found out about this model which seemed like a straight upgrade to me after watching and reading a couple of reviews. After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,1,"10","B08176SM7C","steelseries rival",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,4,"13","B08176SM7C","steelseries rival",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you?

These pudding style keys allow the RGB lighting to come through much brighter than the stock ones and make the lighting effects more impactful, especially those effects which utilize many colors.The main reason I went with the SteelSeries caps as opposed to other pudding-style caps is the inclusion of multiple sets of bottom row keys in this set. Some keyboards (like my Corsair unit) come with different sized bottom row keys, which are not compatible with all sets of keycaps. While this set of keycaps may cost a bit more than other sets out there, the inclusion of multiple sets of bottom keys gives some peace of mind that this set will fit your particular keyboard.Additionally, I like the feel of these keycaps better than the stock ones that ship with the Corsair K70 and I don't think that these get marked up as much from general use.Overall, these SteelSeries Pudding Keycaps are a welcome upgrade to my set up and the added assurance that this set gives by including multiple sizes of bottom row shouldn't be dismissed.",true,1,7,"16","B0954THS76","steelseries rival",false,29.99,"USD",0,0,0,106,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0954THS76","498.20",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - SteelSeries PRISMCAPS - Double Shot Pudding-Style Keycaps - Durable PBT Thermoplastic - Compatible with a W...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71whQaGDLeS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I don't know if Steelseries made those keycaps taller on purpose, or it could be some quality control issues.The factory Apex 7 TKL's keycapshave a really smooth surface without a grainy feeling, and I like it.

They were a little more expensive than the Hyper X pudding caps, but the font is better and there are included keys for standard and non-standard bottom rows. The feel is really nice, the home (F and J) keys have the raised bits, and the illumination factor is UNREAL. A picture can't really do justice to the diffusing factor in the white, bottom part of the keys - and yes, these keys still get plenty bright. The finish on the tops have a nice, slightly textured surface so your fingers don't slide. Nitpicking, if you look really closely, you can see a few dim spots in the traces (like the 8's and 0's), and the finish on the outside of the keys isn't perfect. For instance, on the space bar key there are some very small raised bumps on the top anterior of the black portion. These could probably be sanded off, and are most likely a product of how the black and white parts of the keys are molded. Overall, really nice, would buy again.

I'm a big guy with a wide hand and I like how this mouse just fits perfectly when i use it. I previously used another gaming mouse but never really paid attention to its size until i felt some unease whenever i would use it, and so that's when i decided to look for a much bigger mouse.. I'll say one thing about this item that I would like to address to those who are seeking for a large size mouse, this is the item you probably would like to get. I mean this mouse is longer, a bit more wider and the depth i would say is just fitting for its built. My hand is able to cover the whole mouse giving me a much, much better grasp and hold when use it. Compared to my previous mouse, my fingers would have to sorta adjust to its size and it's just uncomfortable and strains my hand muscles..So, if you're looking for a big mouse to give you a better feel, this is the mouse to go for. Also, as I didn't mention anything about its mechanics and functions, that's because I have no problem with it whatsoever. Everything works as its suppose to.
