"R1AXCMUUEOD8V","Reviewed in the United States on October 6, 2021",2,"This mouse is BIG","I have had a Corsair Glaive since 2018 and I LOVE that mouse. I was disappointed to see that it was essentially discontinued. I started having issues with the middle mouse click and the roller wheel, in that the rubber outer sleeve would just slip around the actual wheel, thus not actually doing any scrolling.So I found this mouse and figured it was probably the closest thing to my beloved Glaive. I was wrong. I used this mouse for probably 3 hours before I decided to return it. The biggest issue is the size of the mouse. I have normal sized hands for my size and my thumb can hardly reach the two forward most thumb buttons. In order for my to use the mouse and all of the buttons, I have to hold it at an angle so that my thumb could actually reach the buttons that I use so commonly in most games. I then started to notice my hand aching more. I grabbed my glaive and within 10 seconds on using it, I got relief. This was the deciding factor to return it.The next issue I had was the material feel and quality. The thumb buttons feel very cheap. They have a good amount of play to them before you actually activate the switch, leading to false pressing the buttons and failing your next combo or whatever. This was less of an issue than the fit.So, if you have bigger than average hands, give this mouse a try. It's attractive, works well with iCUE and is highly customizable. But if your hands are a bit too small, go for the Logitech G502 Hero. I had my coworker bring his in so I could see how it felt, and my hand fits it much better.

"RU9F8JG0WBAVB","Reviewed in the United States on April 29, 2020",5,"Great mouse, as advertised","Was a bit wary going in buying a renewed product, but there was no need. Mouse and 3 grip attachments came safely packaged in great condition. People have complained about the iCUE software, but I don't find it too difficult so long as you do a little bit of research to help yourself out. One important note on that; you can change both the ""hardware actions/lighting"" settings (the default behavior of the lights and programmable buttons when iCUE is NOT running, and have to be saved to the mouse when changed) and the regular ""actions/lighting"" settings (those that take over when iCUE is running, and you can set up different profiles to switch between). The nice thing is you can customize the mouse to your liking and have those settings saved without having iCUE running, or if you need the mouse to be able to adapt to different programs/games etc... you can leave iCUE running and it'll take care of it without needing to re-open the settings and adjust each time.When it comes to the mouse itself, I'm enjoying it so far. Mouse wheel has nice texture and is very responsive, and the two side buttons are in a great spot depending on your grip; and if you prefer one over the other depending on your grip you can easily customize them. On that, it's worth noting; the two side buttons default to serving as the ""back"" and ""forward"" features when navigating the internet which is a nice feature, but you can easily change it if you like. The two buttons in front of the mouse wheel are labelled as the DPI buttons and their default function changes between different DPI levels; however you can also remap these buttons in the same way.The lighting customization is a bit tricky to figure out only because of how many options there are. I'm content with just 1 or 2 solid lights, but the combinations are extensive. Also of note is that the 5 lit bars on the top indicate the DPI profiles you can switch between, and the lighting settings for them is separate in the DPI section of iCUE. The one common complaint I've seen noted is that the lights tend to get warm, but I've found that turning the brightness of the lighting down in the general iCUE settings has prevented this issue so far for me.I have generally larger hands and the mouse fits me reasonably well. I used to use a wrist rest for my mouse but, again depending on the grip, I have found the mouse just as, if not more, comfortable to use without the wrist rest. I don't really have a ""go-to"" grip so to speak, but so far I'd say I've favored a fingertip grip thus far, and is just as comfortable with a full palm grip; the mouse has a very ergonomic shape if this is what you favor, I find it very comfortable.Very important but also quite silly, there is plastic over all the pads on the bottom of the mouse and the bottom of the largest grip attachment... but the plastic is so thin and subtle that I didn't notice them at first. Once one of them started to roll up on the bottom and I then peeled them all off the mouse felt much smoother.",true,1,4,"13","B07XJ4HKZH","corsair glaive",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,102,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ4HKZH","479.40",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR Glaive Pro - RGB Gaming Mouse - Comfortable & Ergonomic - Interchangeable Grips - 18,000 DPI Optical Sensor - Alum...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/616awOPumeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I had used Corsair products before and was very satisfied was their quality and in my mouse search found this little ""gem"" the CorsairGlaive PRO.I guess at 67 years old I need a more conservative-looking mouse instead of one that looks at home on a Klingon battlecruiser. Not saying the Glaive PRO is a ""grandpa"" mouse as it delivers great performance and is easy on the pocketbook. Durability will be the big unknown in this purchase as I have never owned a Corsair mouse. So far it is proving to be a very good value. Though not a Mad Catz with an assortment of accessories including customizable weights to get that ultimate ""gamer"" feel the Corsair Glaive PRO doesn't cost $200+ either which is enough to make any Grandpa smile. It does have three thumb rest pieces that attach securely magnetically, however. Your comfort will be entirely determined by how ""happy"" your hand feels using it, no two people are exactly the same.The Glaive is very comfortable as I use the larger (wider) thumb rest and the software offered at Corsair's website works admirably.Arthritis in my fingers frequently causes me to press the right button with my middle finger as my index presses the left button inadvertently this affliction of advancing years is mediated with the Corsair Glaive's rounded drop off at the front.

Mir ging es hierum, dass ich anfangen wollte von jedem Hersteller die Peripheriegeräte zu testen, weil ich eigentlich immer nur Razer oder Logitech hatte. Mein Arbeitskollege empfohl mir Corsair.TL:DRPros:- gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis- modular wechselbare Daumenablagen- gutes Gewicht und gute Größe (für manche vllt etwas zu leicht)Cons:- Mausrad wirkt nicht wirklich hochwertig- DPI-Knöpfe zu leicht auslösbar- wird sehr schnell heiß, wenn die LEDs an sind (nur über Software ausschaltbar)Ich habe sie für 70€ erworben und für diesen Preis finde ich die Qualität grundlegend gut, die Glaive fühlt sich gut an, ist weder zu schwer noch zu leicht für mich (andere würden sagen, dass sie zu leicht ist) und bietet durch die auswechselbaren Module an der linken Seite der Maus auch ein gutes Gefühl für den Daumen. Die Knöpfe der Maus selber fühlen sich gut an, jedoch sind die DPI-Knöpfe zu leicht zu drücken, weshalb manchmal schon simples streichen über sie, diese auslöst.

With all the not so good reviews, especially about the screen, I hesitated for a long time before to buy it but when I got some money as a gift from a aunt I decided to try it.First of all, the device looks very good quality and it sticks very well to my K95. The buttons and widgets are easy to setup with iCUE and you can configure them as you like (color, size, background image, etc.). You can only set 6 buttons per screen but you can set as many screens as you want and it's easy to switch between them by swiping with your finger. I switched from a two monitors setup to a single 32"" one a year ago and I was missing very much to be able to monitor my temperatures while gaming without having to run some overlay programs. Turns out that thing does it wonderfully well.Unlike some other people said I didn't notice any increase of CPU usage after I connected it (but maybe it's because my Ryzen 5900x just doesn't feel it).About the screen, it's true that if you look at it from an angle you don't see anything anymore but... this thing is not supposed to be looked at from a 45 degree angle. It is supposed to be watched when you are in front of your keyboard and when you do that it's amazingly clear and bright. My only negative point is that the touch functionality when you press a button is not always super reactive but I realize that it works fine if you aim more toward the bottom of the screen instead of the top.

The sniper button is INCREDIBLY useful. I though of it more as a gimmick at first but no it makes such a huge difference in the fine aiming for high zoom weapons or vehicles.As far as ergonomics I have fairly large hands and it fits great. The thumb rest keeps your hand on the mouse and off the pad to make for smooth movement and less drag and the ability to change the weight is more valuable than I first assumed.I picked this up on sale and I think the price point is very fair for what you are getting.

Ergonomics are pretty good, but I find myself sometimes accidentally tapping the thumb buttons or the adjustment buttons under the mouse wheel. The mouse wheel developed a squeak after a month or two. The LEDs are obnoxious, unless you turn them down or off. Which you can do, but that brings us to the software.You must install the Razer apps in order to configure the mouse. You must register to Razer's site and log on via the app. Sometimes, the app forgets your login for some reason (I assume after an update), and you have to log in again. But the updates are the real problem. There are many, many software updates. When there's a new update, every time you log in to your computer, even after waking it of sleep, the big neon green Razer Central screen jumps out at you to tell you that there are app updates. ""Fine"", you think, ""I'll just disable auto updates""'. There's even an option to do so in the settings. The problem? It. Doesn't. Work. It will keep on pestering you every single time they release some update, which happens every week or two. And what's worse, every update requires a reboot. If you don't reboot? It will keep pestering you. Disable the Razer services? The big Razer logo on the mouse will glow a bright, neon green. I've seen discussions on the forums about what firewall ports to disable in order to prevent Razer's apps from phoning home, but that's really way more trouble than I'm willing to go through for a mouse.Simply the worst experience with software I can remember in a very long time.

I figured I was just unlucky and grabbed another because I really like the design of the mouse and how it feels in my hand. However, I am already having issues with this mouse giving the double click issue as well, this time with the right mouse button. I've had this one for even less time than the previous. For something that costs 80 dollars this really isn't acceptable and I will be switching to a different brand for my next one.Also, iCue is the worst software package I have ever used, and is basically required to get any sort of functionality out of the mmo buttons on the side.The Logitech mmo mouse (G600) while not looking nearly as attractive lasted me for about 5 years before I finally gave it to a friend after picking up my first Scimitar. He's still using that mouse. It also comes in at half the price and has a ""better"" software setup. Not that Logi's is amazing either, but it's far better than iCue. Personally, I will probably pick up another of these because I'd rather have something that lasts than something that looks nice and fails in such a short time period.https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Gaming-Backlit-Programmable-Buttons/dp/B0086UK7IQ/",true,1,15,"115","B01MU3DZYN","corsair glaive",false,79.7,"USD",0,0,0,2285,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MU3DZYN","10054.00",false,false,false,false,"Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB - MMO Gaming Mouse - 16,000 DPI Optical Sensor - 12 Programmable Side Buttons - Black","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61S4llvgPZL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I found myself opening the mouse to see why it wasn’t clicking as well as it use to and it turns out the plastic on the button is just wearing down. Plus it’s very easy to get dirty. So cleaning it helped also and I’m able to use it for a bonus extra 3 weeks. I would buy from the company again but they need to make this one smaller and bluetooth. And do something about the plastic wearing down before the actually clicker thingy breaks. Other than that I’ve been using this mouse for almost 2 years, which isn’t enough in my opinion.

I'm not sure why gaming mouses don't have right side buttons. So basically I got this mouse for the buttons.I play 3 different action MMORPGs with action combat, using mouse clicks for skills.The left side buttons are so faulty and trash. There's friction between my finger and the mouse skills popping off when I click.This mouse was not designed for gaming... The left side buttons are too far forward and flimsy. It does not feel like I'm pressing a button, more like reaching for something unsecured and difficult to push.The clickers need to pressed rather than lightly touched. I find this to be harder to deal with ... Think about slamming your hand flat on a table, this is what it feels like to press the clickers.Something more annoying than the buttons is the failure to load. Sharkoon always loads, crosair does not.I have had to restart computer, unplug and replug, even loaded the ique software. Why? Because the mouse DOES NOT COME ON.. A few times it shut off completely.
