It's an easy fix to just go out and buy new skatez, but, for a new product, I should have to just yet.Other things I am not a fan of is this mouse is good for smaller hands, I feel.

"R27NXSEER6QVQ6","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2021",1,"The mouse is fine, but the mandatory G HUB sofware is awful","So Logitech decided to discontinue their software for various devices and consolidate them into on grand app to rule them all: G HUB. Not a bad strategy, but the execution was terrible.The mouse itself is pretty good, but there is no point extolling its virtues, since you shouldn't buy it anyway. In fact, you should not buy any Logitech wireless produce until they've fixed G HUB. Or eradicated it, hired a new engineering team, and written something better to replace it. Or, you know, just reverted to the LGS app that their older mice used that worked just fine for years.There are many reviews detailing G HUB's failings, so I won't list all of them here. I'll add my latest experience to the pile:I got the mouse and installed G HUB several months ago on a system with Windows 8.1. Today, I used the in-app button to upgrade to the latest version. But it turns out the latest version is only compatible with Windows 10. So it tried to upgrade itself and hung forever instead, showing me the cutesy animation that Logitech's engineering department apparently spent their time on instead of doing QA. I didn't even get the courtesy of an error message.As a programmer myself, I can tell you that's an inexcusable, novice, facepalm-grade error. An auto-updater should *always* perform proper version and requirements checks.Anyway, I headed to Logitech's site to find an installer for the earlier Windows 8 compatible version. I knew it existed, since just an hour before it was up and running on my system. But no luck, they now offer Windows 10 or Mac only. So then off to reddit, where quickly I found the hidden link to the older Win7 and Win8 versions. Pay no mind to the ""There are no Downloads for this Version"" message! It's there, or at least it was today, though it may be gone by the time you need it.That installer then failed because it was confused by the current, corrupt installation. So I spent some time ripping that one out by the roots from multiple file system and registry locations. After pausing for a moment to say goodbye to the mouse settings/macros I spent time writing, now all gone, I was able to reinstall it.The whole affair reminded me of this bit from the HHGTTG:“But the plans were on display…”“On display? I eventually had to go down to the cellar to find them.”“That’s the display department.”“With a flashlight.”“Ah, well, the lights had probably gone.”“So had the stairs.”“But look, you found the notice, didn’t you?”“Yes,” said Arthur, “yes I did.

Half the time the first click I make doesn't register and I have to click again. I haven't experienced the double clicks that others have reported, but they may only be a matter of time. The two main buttons overhang the front of the mouse, so if you bump it into anything while moving it, you end up with random clicks.And last but definitely not least, the G-Hub software is absolute garbage. The interface is terrible and difficult to use. Nothing is where you expect it be and you have to click thru different screens to do basic things like remap buttons. It is buggy as hell, locking up when trying to update, requiring uninstalling and reinstalling it to get it to work.

The TLDR is that it's incredibly well built, fully wireless, responsive, and the lightest mouse on the market. And it's pearly white.I don't know what other relevant details I can give. This mouse has been stress-tested by the best in the tech. industry and Logitech weren't lying, this mouse is FAST. It has incredibly low latency, very good battery life (I mean...there's zero RGB lighting), and is quite possibly the safest shape a mouse can come in. If you don't consider your hands much larger or smaller than most people, it will probably be comfortable holding this mouse.The visual design is intelligent. It has this elegance that isn't the embarrassing ""gamer"" stylings of other products but isn't so minimalistic that you wouldn't immediately recognize this mouse at first glance. Anybody who's ever used this mouse knows exactly what this feels and looks like.Is this mouse necessary? Absolutely not. I think the only thing more over-the-top than this mouse is the amount of R&D and feedback Logitech went through to create one of the best mice in PC gaming. I do prefer the Razer Viper Ultimate over this because I prefer the texture and shape. I am also bothered that a $150 computer mouse looks almost too simple. Also, in my opinion, the Viper Ultimate doesn't feel that much heavier than this. I wanted to note that, in case anybody wanted a cheaper alternative.Overall, this mouse is a flex, or for anybody who wants to go out of their way to spend time and money on their gaming hobby (gaming career maybe?). I considered buying this since it launched and was not disappointed.

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse. If you have large hands (especially in length), I highly recommend this mouse because you can claw and fingertip this mouse comfortably, and maybe even palm grip.

So far the G502 has treated me really well with its functionality. The mouse software, G HUB, lets you set almost any Windows shortcuts per buttons, such as having 'Copy' (Ctrl + C) on your MOUSE4, and 'Paste' on your MOUSE5. Has good functionality across apps too, like Discord, where you can mute yourself at anytime with a button click.For gaming it feels smooth, with adjustable DPI settings also at a button click (by default).
