"RTB9AWLRB7F9C","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2021",3,"Almost","I really had high hopes for this laptop but I found a couple of issues that caused me to return it. First, there was a little bit of backlight bleed on the bottom left side of the screen. While the screen was nice and there was the normal amount of IPS glow, the little white light bleeding through on the bottom left caused me some concern. Although it was not much, it was enough for me to wonder if it would get worse over time. Knowing that there have been some who have complained about screen issues, I did not want to take the chance.Second, the laptop had a few keys that had tactile issues. The #3, #4, and W were not as responsive and springy as the other keys. When I barely moved my fingers across the number row without applying pressure, I could feel that the #3 and #4 keys seemed to be off a little. It worked when typing but I could tell the difference between them and the other keys. The W key was not as bad but you could still feel the difference between it and the Q, E, A, and S. While they may have never caused any issues throughout the life of the laptop, I don't want to take that risk with a $1000+ laptop. I have seen videos and forum posts about this same model where keys are sticking and/or not responding. I did not want to send it to Lenovo for warranty service since I just bought it. Personally, I don't trust a device that has to receive warranty repairs right out of the box. Hopefully, Lenovo can address these issues because this seems like it could be a very great machine.",true,1,1,"10","B08YKG5K7F","hp victus",false,1049.99,"USD",0,0,0,417,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKG5K7F","1876.50",false,false,false,false,"Lenovo Legion 5 15 Gaming Laptop, 15.6"" FHD (1920 x 1080) Display, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H Processor, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB NVMe ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fzx0pGY5L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R6X2MFK0OSG0","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021",2,"Good price for Ryzen 5000 series... However","Ordered this machine as it's the best value for a Ryzen 5000 series CPU which comes with an earlier generation graphics card. (GTX1650). The engineers over at Lenovo took some serious shortcuts with this machine, possibly to encourage consumers to move up to their Legion line. This machine is advertised to allow storage expansion via an open second M. 2 slot, at the expense of the open 2.5"" HDD/SSD bay. You have to choose between them because the second M. 2 slot literally blocks the installation of a 2.5"" drive. There is no work around for this whatsoever. So I decided to do without the 2.5"" bay and I stall a second NVMe, only to see the manufacturer did not install (not include) a standoff for the second SSD. The female threads are there, but no standoff. I immediately called Lenovo and they gave me the part number for the screw pack (which includes the oddly sized standoff) However that part is on back-order and a ship date is unknown. Thankfully some folks on here appear to have received the SSD standoff installed (some machines arrive with it installed in the 2242 position requiring it to be moved to allow 2280) Bit mine arrived with none.So with a brand new 1TB M.2 2280 SSD in hand and no way to install it due to the manufacturer's oversight I initiated a RMA.Coming from last year's Acer Nitro 5, this machine is a definite downgrade. The Acer included all required hardware and their support experience is far above Lenovo. I'm surprised by this as Lenovo is well known for high quality products. But this seems to be true only for their upper end SKU's.I decided to she'll out an extra $200 to go back to the Acer Nitro Series with slightly upgraded specs. IMHO this is well worth the extra cost to avoid future issues with the Lenovo Gaming 3, which is a far lower end machine overall.The cooling on the Lenovo Gaming 3 is another strange engineering fault. It's unclear why they would place the main exhaust literally at the hinge of the laptop's display. In closed position (where many people will have it to use external monitor setup) it blocks roughly 50% of the rear exhaust port by having the lid closed. With the lid open, the extremely hot air is rushed directly towards the bottom half of the display. There is also a second exhaust port which isn't fully utilized by the machine. On Lenovo's high end Legion machines the thermal solution makes sense as the display is moved forward to accommodate. Even with the highly efficient AMD 5600h, this machine gets hot fast. This is another huge oversight by Lenovo on this SKU.But if you don't plan on doing any upgrades or just plan on adding a bit of memory and using the machine as is, this is the cheapest priced Ryzen 5000 with a discrete GPU. If you want full upgradability and a more reliable feature set, it's worth paying $200 more to get the Acer Nitro 5 with a current gen 3060 GPU which allows 3 storage options at once and reliable cooling with it's quad exhaust setup. Lenovo is still a good brand but it's worth paying a bit more now for the Legion model or a Acer Nitro, etc. than settling for this budget offering.",true,1,2,"11","B08YKHGKTV","hp victus",false,699.99,"USD",0,0,0,123,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKHGKTV","541.20",false,false,false,false,"Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15 15.6"" Laptop, 15.6"" FHD (1920 x 1080) Display, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lNj3046jL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R1VONG2FBIEZWN","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2021",5,"Fantastic Value Buy!","I did alot of research prior to my purchase and this deal hands down was the absolute best for my use case. I needed a new laptop for work and with the next gen console nightmare I thought Id get one that can do a bit of intermediate level gaming as well.Firstly the look of most laptops in this price range were a no go for me. The hp pavilion and acer nitro look too ""gamery"" as I carry this to work with me most days. This laptop unlike those looks standard and Lenovo is a brand I've had many positive experiences with before.The speed is lightning quick and I've added an additional 8 gb of ram and a 1tb m.2 ssd which has improved performance even more and covered my one gripe which was the lack of storage. The upgrade itself was pretty easy to do myself.As for the gamimg experience, with only a gtx 1650 you do have to tone down your settings in most titles to come close to capping out your 120hz screen but I'm fine with that. I've attached two pictures of apex legends in the firing range after running around, shooting and using abilities for 5 mins each doing my best to simulate what your in-game experience would be. One picture shows the results at all min settings and the other at all max settings. At all max the fps dips to between 30 to 40 with alot of stuff happening on the screen (bangalore smokes and simultaneous ultimates for example). This isnt really playable in a game where frames matter. At all min you sit at 110 to 130 most of the time with a dip to maybe 70-80 under the conditions I detailed above. The textures are pretty bad however. I've settled on a low-med mix that nets me around 80-90 most of the time. Compared to my ps4 (RIP my next gen ownership ambition btw) this feels amazing. If you want to experience games at their full graphical intensity and dont want to be forced to skimp on visuals look elsewhere but be prepared to pay at least 100% more for a 3060 laptop or at least 30-50% more on a 3050ti laptop.If this is your budget then I DEFINITELY recommend this laptop.",true,1,2,"11","B08YKHGKTV","hp victus",false,699.99,"USD",0,0,0,123,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKHGKTV","541.20",false,false,false,false,"Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3 15 15.6"" Laptop, 15.6"" FHD (1920 x 1080) Display, AMD Ryzen 5 5600H Processor, NVIDIA GeForce GTX ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lNj3046jL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

It has met my expectations for performance.Pros:-Speed is excellent-Nice feature set (SD reader!)Cons:-Can get warm during heavier use/charging-Screen brightness is 'meh'I was a little weary of ordering a laptop through Amazon but the price for the config I wanted was hard to argue (could not find a lower price for 16GB/1 TB option anywhere - even if I did it myself). Laptop showed up quickly and has worked great. There is some bloatware, so take some time initially to scrub it. I chose the HP laptop based on reviews and that it was one of the few that actually had a SD card reader. While it seems minor, it is one last peripheral to carry. I use it with Cura frequently and it boots very fast and slices quickly. Light gaming has been speedy and more than sufficient. Battery life is average - not horrible but not great.It can get warmer when charging or gaming. I bought a melamine cutting board to keep my laptop off my lap and have found it to be a low cost option to keep the fan ports unobstructed (not needed for light activities but let's me place it on soft surfaces, etc. without any worries).The screen is probably my only real complaint. It works fine - colors are acceptable and response is fine. It is just not that bright. This is the only reason I have not given this 5 stars.

I used some screen cleaner along with the microfiber towel that came with the laptop to get the majority out, so that was solved.Now as far performance, I spend initial time updating the graphics driver which was easy and noticed that most drivers were up to date which was good.I used 3DMARK to run a check on the processor and Video card. Got the following for CPUMax threads 371716 threads 36658 threads 32884 threads 23682 threads 14191 thread 727And as far as GPU I got a 6287 time spy scoreWhich is higher then a lot of laptop gaming PCs.So the scores were within what you would expect.What was concerning was how hot the cpu temp got during testing. Went over 90 Celsius a good portion of the test while the GPU went to 75 Celsius.I might have to check and see if it’s the thermal paste they used but not sure if I want to mess around either with it.So it is heavy due to the big battery which you would expect from a gaming pc, the fans do their job but you hear them and it gets hot.Performance wise the screen is amazing and gaming on it is awesome. I used it first day to play the new world beta and it looked and played awesome.Very pleased.Update 8/6/21I am moving the laptop from 4 stars to 5Like I mentioned above the laptop gets hot when you play for a long time and I recommend headphones or ear buds while gaming as having the fan to max (by pressing FN and F8(fan key) can be veeeery loud!But the benchmarks I initially posted are low as compared to what I am getting now as I did not have it to the extreme performance on the MSI Dragon Center clicked before. This laptop is a powerhouse!Update 8/10/21:Didn't mention this in my previous review but the ""brick"" or power supply is terrible. With a system like this you end up having to use the power supply alot as the battery drains pretty quickly if your not hooked up. Well the issue is with the cord, the cord is too short. You end up sometimes having to either lift the brick off the ground and put it on the couch with your or try to get it real close to the chair, its just too short...

"R7V4V7Z9N4YJ8","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2021",5,"Nice value and easy to upgrade","I wanted a decently-equipped, lightweight 14-inch laptop to use on the go without breaking the bank and this hit all the notes.I wound up dual-booting it with Pop OS and setup worked well and the 256 GB drive left me more than enough space for a dual install.The memory is partially soldered to the motherboard while another 4 GB stick is replaceable so I swapped that out with an 8 GB one to bump up the system memory to 12 GBs.I believe it can handle up to 20 GB(16 GB stick + 4 GB), and noticed that memory usage in Windows 10 was more stable with the upgrade.That said, 8 GBs is likely more than enough.You can also replace the SSD with another NVMe, though make sure you get the right form factor - it's a 2242 (the smallest one) in case you're looking.But it's quite easy to replace it if you want.I've not tried to stress-test the CPU but I've been able to run a docker image + multiple Chrome tabs + VS code without the fan even kicking on, and my guess is it could handle light-ish gaming as well.For basic office/web/home usage it'll be more than enough.Again, calibrate your expectations but this isn't a bargain-basement device.Screen is solid - it's FHD but at 14 inches you don't see much pixelation and the IPS limits washout from different angles.Brightness is solid as well, though it's certainly not the brightest you'll see.But again, it's good for the price point.And the backlit keyboard has multiple brightness settings depending on the environment.My one big complain is the USB-C port is for data transfer only - no power in or video out.The device has a full-size HDMI port so it's not a deal-breaker but I really would have liked to not have to carry around a device-specific charger.Not a deal breaker but that feels like an unnecessary corner to cut.Still, a good value thus far and I'm happy with how this Ideapad will scale with my needs.",true,1,10,"19","B08YKDYWK5","hp victus",false,629.98,"USD",0,0,0,109,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YKDYWK5","490.50",false,false,false,false,"Lenovo IdeaPad 3 14 Laptop, AMD Ryzen 5 5500U Processor, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB NVMe TLC SSD Storage, 14.0"" FHD (1920 x 1080)...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K2sPFdi+L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Screen has a beautiful display. RGB Chroma makes it look cool. Most importantly it runs most games out there at 1920 x 1080 resolution on ultra high settings with no noticeable FPS drops. Yes it does get hot when running games at those settings but if you play it in an A/C cooled room, connected to a TV via HDMI, it doesnt get as hot. And its How I always used the laptopThat is also why my review is a 2 Star rating. In less than one year the HDMI port on my laptop stopped working. The computer does detect the TV and lets me assign a resolution for it but theres no display on my TV. Its funny that one should pay over $2000 on a computer for it to start breaking apart in less than a year. After trying litterally every troubleshooting step I could find and contacting Razer they decided I should send the computer for repair. And as of now Im waiting for them to reply to me. Havent heard from them since before yesterday.I will update the review as the story develops. But as of now I could not justify their ultra expensive release prices for their products if they are not even going to outlast the manufacturers warranty.Update 1: Razer will sell their products to Puerto Rico customers. Even on their webise they will ship them to Puerto Rico. Even Best Buy storea in the island sell Razer products. But in case of a warranty claim. If the product needs to be sent for repairs/replacement, it has to be sent first to an address in the USA so it can then be sent to Razer.This might also apply to any US territory.

If you just use a mouse you won't have to worry about that. It also scrolls backwards up is down and down is up, you can fix that in the touchpad settings.Other than that it's typical windows, takes 20 minutes to download updates and get it set up.
