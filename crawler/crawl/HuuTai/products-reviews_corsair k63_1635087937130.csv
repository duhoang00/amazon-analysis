The purpose was to get a nice full sized board with silent linear switches to replace another small board I was using.The first problem to occur was a constant key spam issue. Support was helpful and RMA'd the unit. The process was archaic and a pain to complete. Requiring RMA numbers all over the box, and a paper trail explaining the issue and why RMA was the resolution. FedEx was way more helpful with the shipping process and getting everything sorted out.Took a week or two to get a new board from Hong Kong which wasn't too slow for the distance. The replacement board immediately had an issue with the Numpad 8 key being chipped on the inside probably from a manufacturing issue.

"R2LZT110IV9KJI","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",1,"Horrible battery life, bad connections","I was excited to receive this keyboard.I had been watching it for a while and finally decided to buy it.It is not cheap, and being a Razer product, I was expecting something really good.Instead, I am returning the keyboard due to really poor performance.After I received the keyboard I immediately removed it from the packaging and plugged it in so it would charge.Once fully charged, I kept the keyboard plugged in via the supplied USB cable to do the setup and customization.I did not want to drain the battery at all during this processes.Once everything was setup, I ""Synced"" the keyboard to the computer using the supplied 2.4 GHz Hyperspeed Dongle.Once all setup was complete, I disconnected the USB cable so I could use it wirelessly.My first issue with the keyboard is how loud it is.I did my research on this keyboard before buying it and selected the Yellow keys - ""silent and linear"".I fully understand mechanical keys are not perfectly silent, but this is the loudest keyboard I have ever used, and I have been in the technology field for a long time, so I have used some old mechanical keyboards.This is the least of my issues with the keyboard, as this could possibly be ignored, but it was an issue, so I wanted to make sure to get it out there that this is a LOUD keyboard.My second issue was the connection.This keyboard would lose connection at times when using the ""Hyperspeed"" connection.I would have to patiently wait a while for it to connect again, or turn the keyboard off and back on again.Please note, the computer is only about 3 feet away from the keyboard with nothing obstructing the signal between the two items.I decided to try the Bluetooth connection...no luck.My computer has no problem detecting other Bluetooth devices, no matter what the device is, the age, or the brand.However, my computer could never ""find"" this keyboard.I even tried making sure it was the only Bluetooth device in the area turned on, and it still never found it.So, my only course of action was to plug the ""wireless"" keyboard in with the supplied USB cable to ensure I would not lose connection with the computer.My third issue.Not sure how to describe this, but it would randomly do things.After having the wireless keyboard plugged in as a wired keyboard (if you can't tell I am frustrated about this, I am), I would be typing and it would randomly open the start menu or task manager.Other times it would just randomly throw up a string of letters that I didn't type.I am not sure how this happened, and only happened a few times before I decided to box this up and start the return process, but it was weird and random.I have never seen that before with.My final issue, and perhaps the most important was the battery life.As I indicated earlier I let the keyboard fully charge before using, and I kept it plugged in while doing the initial setup.I had the keyboard unplugged and working as a wireless keyboard for maybe a little over an hour before reconnecting to become a wired keyboard.Of course, during that time I had the lights going and was using it as a normal keyboard (not gaming, just internet and email) and of course fighting the connection issues.When I pugged the keyboard back in and went back into the Razer Synapse application, I noticed the battery charge had dropped to 76%.WHAT?!?!?!In just over an hour the battery was drained 24%?This is ridiculous.The keyboard I was replacing (and now using for this review) is a wireless backlit keyboard that only needs to be charged once every few months.This keyboard would not even make it through a full day using it as designed with lights active.I could not imagine anyone using this for gaming as it would surely die before the game is finished.So my options now were to either leave the keyboard plugged in, which defeats the purpose of buying a wireless keyboard (and deal with the weird random letters and opening of other applications); or turning the light effects off to save battery life, which defeats the purpose of buying an expensive RGB keyboard.Either way, I would not get what I paid a lot of money for.So, I am returning the keyboard.",true,1,6,"15","B08FQTK1RW","corsair k63",true,179.99,"USD",229.99,50,21.74,682,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FQTK1RW","2932.60",false,false,false,false,"Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro Mechanical Wireless Gaming Keyboard: Green Mechanical Switches - Tactile & Clicky - Chroma RGB Lig...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RyDhL6FjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R29NH6RU20KFL7","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2021",1,"Stopped Connecting to Anything After Just 2 Months of Use","I got this keyboard to replace a Huntsman optical that overall was doing great, but I had an issue with the volume knob (which I use quite regularly) and for me it wasn't the best tying experience for working and gaming. I needed a keyboard that was a little more clicky as I was accidentally hitting other keys with the very short travel of the Huntsman optical. I also wanted wireless so I could pair my work laptop via bluetooth and either connect via a cable or dongle with my personal computer.The Blackwidow V3 Pro at first was amazing. Connected quickly and reliably, the typing experience was much better for my work, the volume knob worked great unlike my Huntsman optical, and the RGB matched perfectly with my other peripherals, and I was in heaven.Then the 2-3 key presses started happening. This wasn't something I noticed with a lot of reviews when I purchased this, but looking back this is a huge problem with this keyboard. This is very problematic depending on what type of game you're playing or if you're pulling double duty and using this keyboard for work. Constantly editing emails or documents was getting very old.I also ran into connection issues after just a month. At first it was just not connecting to bluetooth as quickly, but then if I was using the 2.4Ghz dongle on my personal rig during a game, it would just cut out. It was 3 feet away and within perfect line of sight. Then it got so bad I had to just start plugging it in to game because of random disconnects. It also started randomly flashing the lights.Then today it just stopped connecting to anything. Won't connect to bluetooth, the 2.4ghz dongle or a wired connection. It won't pair with anything new but I was able to reset it and then update the firmware. Then it registers with Synapse if I have it plugged in, but it is still not usable at all. No key presses will register. Also if I press keys while it's connected via the USB cord, it will do random colors like rainbow wave, or do green pulse from where I push the key. The keyboard is entirely useless now after just 2 months.Do not buy this keyboard, or if you do, get a warranty. This is the 2nd Razer keyboard in a row that's had problem.

A lot of my comments follow what other reviews have said.Yes the keyboard is a bit loud as others have stated, but it isn't an issue for me, so I couldn't put it as a pro or con.Pros -The keyboard feels nice, it is heavy and feels like it has quality materials.The lighting controls work with the iCUE software and there are many customizable options and profiles.responsiveness of the keyboard is great.Cons -Unfortunately there are no ports on this keyboard, but I dont tend to use them myself. But this maybe a con for someone else.I have seen this issue on many other reviews and I have the same major issue. During the first month of use my A key (extremely important for gaming) started to experience key chatter, the key would register twice and when held the action would not be sustained. Fortunately for me I was still in the first month of use I got a free replacement with return. Because of this reason I had to give a 3/5 star review.

I pulled the key off, saw nothing on the board nor within the key itself, used canned air just in case, put it back together, and the same issue.If cleaning didn't work, the second option was to force the keyboard into ""CRP_Disabled"" drive and sent me files to replace the firmware.bin. Since I tried this, following their instructions step-by-step, my keyboard no longer works at all. No lights, no response, nothing. I tried different USB ports, reset my computer, tried a different computer, nothing. I can get it back to the ""DRP_Disabled"" drive but that's it.Not happy.

Returned and getting the 915 with beautiful clicky keys.And since I got the combo. the MX Master is not a BAD mouse either... it's ergonomically fitting to my hand, a nice change to the sometimes too-small gaming mice that Logitech designs for my bigger hands.. But the side scroll is defunct and the forward/back buttons are literally on top of each other in a diagonal fashion. This makes it very tough to hit the correct button the first time. Worst of all however is the fact the polling rate is only 125hz. They say you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.. well with this mouse you can take 100 shots and miss a damn well lot of them due to the low rate. Again, returning this as well and getting the G502 wireless.Logitech needs to rethink their branding for this keyboard/mouse. You can even see from a lot of the reviewers here, this is ideally an OFFICE keyboard/mouse setup. Not a gaming setup! The gaming equivalents are the G915 keyboard and G502 or G903 or G604 or G703 or.. y'know what? There's a lot of good logitech gaming mice out there..

The switches would routinely duplicate the letters, and at one point even the backspace key failed (same style switch). Thankfully the switches are replaceable with a little soldering skill, but this is a real nuisance.

STILL having switch failures. On the original keyboard I have now replaced a total of EIGHT switches, on the newer one I've had to replace two.Until/unless Logitech gets better switches I would avoid this keyboard. I didn't bother going through customer service because I knew I could repair this issue myself, but not everyone has the tools or is handy. If you're handy and don't mind replacing switches, I've otherwise enjoyed the keyboard. Keystrokes are nice, responsiveness is excellent, and the range of the wireless is great.

"R161YJG97KZXE7","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",3,"Much dimmer key light and lightweight/flimsy feel compared to my mechanical keyboard","I bought this to replace a backlit, but non-RGB tenkeyless mechanical keyboard with this one. My initial reactions were that the spacebar was WAY WAY WAY too loud, the keyboard tactile feedback felt cheap and hollow, and that the backlight was only about half as bright as my non-RGB backlit keyboard.I searched on youtube and found a lot of people who had felt the same way about the loud spacebar sound. I even watched some videos where people had put keyboard o-rings on and reported NO DIFFERENCE. I watched a video where someone put TWO sets of o-rings on the keys and reported NO DIFFERENCE.So... I ordered a set of 40A and 80A orings, and put the 40A on first, then the 80A, and after doing that, I felt that the tactile feedback seemed good and the spacebar sound was acceptably dampened.At this point, I replaced my MAX Blackbird Tenkeyless with my quieted Razer Huntsman. My initial reaction was that the MAX Blackbird is WAY more durable and substantial, and that while RGB is fun, the backlighting on the MAX Blackbird was literally about twice as bright. I debated for a long time about just putting this keyboard in my parts box and keep using my old keyboard.But, I'd already invested the time and since having RGB keyboard/mouse/mouse pad had been so important to me for some intangible reason, I stuck with it.Aside from the flimsier keycaps, and noisy keys, the opto-mechanical switches are REALLY FAST and I have no complaints about this keyboard for gaming. The downside of this to me is that I'm finding that I'm making a LOT more typing errors with this keyboard as the keys are much more sensitive (too sensitive?), but I'm adapting.I just wish there were a higher end Razer tenkeyless keyboard that felt more substantial, had twice the brightness, and had a purchase option for pudding keycaps (since you can't find a set that 100% fits this keyboard).",true,1,11,"110","B07V25YPVW","corsair k63",true,99.99,"USD",129.99,30,23.08,4111,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V25YPVW","18910.60",false,false,false,false,"Razer Huntsman Tournament Edition TKL Tenkeyless Gaming Keyboard: Fastest Keyboard Switches Ever - Linear Optical Switches...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ikKpHAlBL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The kicker is that even though this Keyboard was released over 2 years ago it DOES NOT have a firmware update tool like the huntsman, Huntsman Elite, and mini have.

Shady company.","First thing to know is that the Bluetooth functionality with this keyboard is 100% broken and will not work for any length of time. When it does, the keyboard enters sleep mode with no actual way to turn it off, regardless of what their software or firmware updates claim to have fixed. After a replacement and several firmware upgrades over the year and a half it rarely, if ever, connects wirelessly, and when it does, the battery lasts an hour tops. Since this is advertised as a Bluetooth keyboard I'd call this listing borderline fraudulent.The layout choice is also horrible - question mark key placement is idiosyncratic to this keyboard so you have to retrain your muscle memory. Other 60% boards do not make this very obvious and avoidable mistake.RGB functionality is mediocre but the backlighting itself is more than adequate and has several color presets and brightness settings.The support and documentation are both absolutely abysmal. It's obvious none of the people working for Dierya have the English skills necessary to support a product this complicated in the US market.Finally, switches and keycaps are just okay.
