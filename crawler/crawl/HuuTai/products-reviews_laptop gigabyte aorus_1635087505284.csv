At night I game, for a few hours before bed. I have not had a Laptop for several years preferring to build my own computer and continually upgrade. Needless to say I was nervous about getting a Laptop.having an issue with the laptop after only a week of use only made me have buyers remorse. Thankfully tho Computer Upgrade Kings with Amazon worked with me on figuring out the problem with the laptop and got a replacement in just a few days.I am not sure what the problem was exactly with the laptop. The battery life went from 4+ hours on delivery to <1 hour a week later. The Laptop was overheating and crashing during the boot cycle.The new Laptop is working very well, good battery life @ ~ 6 hours gaming time with the GPU at max.It does run warm while plugged in but not past 75C. It will run cooler while under battery power. I believe this is because it dials down the power consumption. I have mine on a cooling pad and the GPU stays <65C consistently.All-in-all its a good laptop.

The RAM part was fine, but they put an Adata Swordfish 2tb SSD in it, and the performance of those is known to be terrible. I have no idea why they would spec a low-performance drive like that as the main drive for a laptop with this sort of performance, but they did. It would actually be a good add-on as a 2nd drive, but they should disclose exactly what drive they put in it as an ""upgrade"" vs a generic product description entry like it is so people are aware and can plan accordingly.

"R3A18U57HWM5BE","Reviewed in the United States on October 22, 2021",5,"Super fast laptop for work!","I don't use this laptop to play games, but to work editing videos with 2D and 3D animations. Compared to my desktop i7-7820X, this i7-11800H is 25% faster, but the difference is in the NVidia Geforce RTX 3070 video card, it is 4 times faster than my desktop NVidia Geforce RTX 1660. I can work on it 8K videos in DaVinci Resolve 17 without any problem and animate in Fusion easily due to its 8 GB of VRAM. The prices of electronic products are going up, so I decided to buy it now before the prices go up any more.Another advantage of this laptop is its aluminum chassis, which unlike my previous laptops, is very strong and feels sturdy. The mechanical keyboard is very good and the battery life of about 4 hours is relatively acceptable for a laptop with that much power.

"R7QPN8MJ2KBUX","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2018",3,"Overpowered and Unneccessary (A 1 year Later Review)","The Aorus X5 V7, laptop does it's job, with an i7-7820HQ CPU and full size GTX 1070 with 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, it smashes the most demanding games on the max graphics, such as The Witcher 3, The Division, Arma 3, and the new Black Ops 4.While it does accomplish it's job, there are a lot of unnecessary features that make me regret purchasing this laptop when it was $2500. (As of 9/18/18, it is $1799.00 on Amazon).The Unnecessary Features/ Negatives1) You don't need the Overclockable CPU, it's not worth the extra processing speed, and contributes to the laptop's overall heat (this laptop runs 80-90 degrees Celsius normally with AAA games).2) You don't need the 3K, 2880 x 1620 pixels screen resolution. On a 15.6 inch screen, one can't tell the difference between 1080p and 1620p resolutions with most games. (Running it on a higher resolution just contributes to the heat anyway)3) The Screen is only a 59.97 Hz refresh rate, meaning that the max FPS you can get is 60 with any game, this seems a bit counter intuitive when you have a 3K resolution screen, and a full size GTX 1070 graphics card. The laptop does have G-Sync capabilities which does help when you have a screen that is capped at 60 FPS, but one would rather have a 144 Hz refresh screen than one with the extra cost added on because of G Sync and higher resolution.4) The laptop runs REALLY HOT, on most modern AAA games, the laptop (When using MSI Afterburner) clocks temperatures of 80-90 degrees Celsius. Which makes the laptop unable to be played on a lap, unless you want to scald yourself, I even bought a laptop cooler, which doesn't help much at all. The keyboard even gets so hot, it's at time unbearable to be playing on it, even on a desk.- The added processing power of the i7-7820HQ processor just adds too much heat to the compact design of this laptop. And now that there are the 8th gen CPUs out, the 7820HQ is just obsolete.- Even the power brick gets hot to the touch. Recommending you leave it somewhere away from your feet.5) The laptop within a couple days of delivery, would randomly shut down ( no BSOD), just a random freeze for about 5 seconds, then a full shutdown. Assuming related to the heating issues, there's no error message so there's no way to tell).6) After a year and a couple weeks ( The warranty is only for a YEAR by the way), I started to get awkward BSODs, and using the Manufacturer's Driver Update Utility (Aorus) is not recommended. Most of the Drivers that the program gives you are out of date by more than a few months, free programs such as Driver Booster from iObit work a lot better. The BSODs would give Driver Verifier DMA Violation errors, and no error code, so yet another random shut down that is un-diagnosable.- After performing a fresh install of Windows 10 and all applications. I performed a hard drive health check with HWinfor, and found that the M.2 SSD was already at 74%. Which is very low for a 1 year old laptop. The issues are likely related to the terrible heat managing system for the beefy specs.7) If you do lose a key (which I did), there is not a place that I could find, online or offline, that provides key replacements. The only way you could get a replacement, is to pay for shipping, ship it to the nearest service center for Aorus, and get the entire keyboard replaced.8) Because of the heat requirements, the fans get REALLY loud, you will NEED to use headphones or crank up the speakers all the way. My friend described it as a ""Jet Engine"" when playing with the fans at maximum. High pitched and very loud, you can't game in public like the library, or a coffee shop. ( Make sure to clean the fans regularly, I had the right fan start to go out on me after about 8 months, and it never got back up to it's full speeds after cleaning).The Positives1) It gets the job done, runs the games, and gives 60 FPS comfortably on 1080p resolution ( I almost never found the need to run the laptop on 1620p)2) The keyboard is really nice, feels great, and has great response (Until I lost a key). The individually lit RGB software is easy to use and a nice add-on.3) The profile makes it inconspicuous, and doesn't ""scream"" gamer laptop. With the black metal frame, and only a lit up Aorus logo on the top, it prevents distractions when using it in public.4) Despite the Heating issues, and the temperatures that the laptop reaches, there is a good default fan controlling software (Command and Control) that lets you ramp up the fans as much as they can go, which stabilizes the temperatures at least to the range of 80-90 C.5) The Laptop comes with attachable feet, as if they knew you would need more circulation for this laptop, which haven't failed me in helping the laptop cool itself.6) G-Sync capabilities are nice, you rarely notice screen tears, and you can even change the settings to apply to not only fullscreen mode when gaming.7) The IO is very nice, providing an Ethernet Port, 2 USB 3.0 slots (Thunderbolt 3 Support), 2 USB 2.0 slots, an HDMI slot. an SD card slot, a separate mic and headphone jack, a USB A slot, and a Kensington slot. You won't need an extra USB splitter unless you are using all peripherals.8) The weight for what it contains is very nice, allowing extreme portability for such a powerful machine. Only weighing 5.5 pounds (past 6.0 if you carry the power brick).9) The battery lasts 3-4 hours depending on what you are doing, which is very respectable for a gaming laptop with such powerful specs, if you plan on taking it to more than a few classes, I'd recommend taking the power brick with you.10) The speakers are really nice, they get very loud, and have good sound quality even at the max volumes, you rarely hear peaking or loss in quality unless it's the file itself you are listening to.11) The X-Rite Pantone Calibration, allows for one to flip a switch and get good color accuracy.Overall, the laptop does it's job, plays games with a small figure. However, at a year later, this laptop is not worth it. For what I paid for, I rarely need to overclock the CPU, and since doing that will increase the heat output even further than it already does, I'm sure you'd be putting the laptop on its deathbed. Now with laptops giving 144 Hz refresh rate, 1080p screens, with 8th generation i7 and i5 CPUs, this laptop has been effectively phased out. The negatives of this laptop just make it not worth your money.",true,1,3,"12","B07123ZNTY","laptop gigabyte aorus",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,14,3.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07123ZNTY","43.40",false,false,false,false,"Aorus X5 v7-KL3K3D 15.6"" Notebook IPS WQHD+ 7th Gen Intel i7-7820HK, GeForce GTX 1070 8GB, 16GB DDR4, 256GB SSD Win 10 Sli...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71t57jfTrmL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Both can be upgraded.8. Dedicated audio card.9. 4 speakers. See cons also.Cons.1. Heat. It gets hot on the bottom side.2. Fans can be really noisey when you dont set them up correctly.3. Its only a 60hz screen in $2300.00 laptop.4. Track pad could be better.5. The aorus software it hard to get used to and could be better implimented.6. Battery life sucks.7. Speakers lack substance.I know I have a few cons on here but you cannot have it all. This is a gaming laptop, it will get hot especially with the hardware that is in it. It has plenty or storage and ram and both can be upgraded. Theres an open m.2 slot and two open ram slots. The screen is very nice and can get bright but its a small thing that its only 60hz. Its plenty but for the price it could have been better. The aorus software works fine once you get to know how it operates. I wish there was a better tutorial out there for it. Once you get used to it, the software is fine. I wish they would have used optimus instead of g-sync. I have tried a few other laptops such as the acer predator triton 700 gtx 1060 (I could not get used to the track pad and keyboard location but over all nice. It also had a very clicky keyboard), razer blade 14 gtx 1060( it ran hot all the time and the fans were really loud, like a small jet engine, also limited upgradeability), gigabyte aero 15 ( I know same manufacture but the aero 15 was very nice, small, compact, and great battery life, but it had a few down falls. Coil whine, weak screen hinges, lound ac charger, screen sleep closing angle was way to early like at 45 degrees, plus I had one die on me), 2017 macbook pro 256gb model. (Very nice, great battery life, thin, great speakers, and great screen. The downsides of the macbook pro were no upgrade options. Repair cost were out of sight, and only thunderbolt port options.)The aorus x5 v7 fit the bill of all my needsd of storage and ram capacity, great screen, full size keyboard and backlit, 15 inch, powerful graphics card and cpu.

"R2E8D9X7MO4CF1","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2017",5,"Great laptop for editing, gaming on ultra - Gigabyte did well with this one!","This review is for the x5 v7 model - I purchased this laptop mostly for video editing but also some gaming on the go. I've had the X5 v7 about two and a half weeks and these are my impressions of it so far:Pros:OCs very well - 4.3GHz stock and can be pushed more in the BIOS if you want.X-Rite pantone screen color profile looks great.The Command and Control and Driver update Utility are awesome and make monitoring your machine easy. I really like if you minimize C&C utility that you get a dashboard with all the important machine info like GPU-CPU load, temps, fan speeds, adjust OC.Full metal body feels sturdy and doesn't creak.RGB keyboard looks even on each key and has a lot of options via software.1070 is a beast and can play most games on max quality.Thunderbolt 3 port is a huge space saver - I'm using this dock for everything but powering the laptop: Dell 3GMVT Thunderbolt Dock TB16, 240W, blackWeighs only 5.5 lbs - not bad for how powerful it is.Cons:A little ""flash-lighting"" in upper right corner.Screen is a little flimsy compared to rest of laptop.Laptop is a fingerprint magnetBottom panel to get to internals is a little sharp- be careful when opening it!Things to note:Battery life on a laptop like this while gaming is not good, but that should be expected!It gets loud under full load. When not using it for gaming or encoding, I set fan mode to quiet and it's super quiet.Overall, it's a good laptop and the con's aren't deal-breakers for me.

"R3JD6AUOCNYWQ","Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2021",2,"Laptop heat ruined the SSD inside","I’ve had this laptop for a few months, probably around half a year, and its worked pretty great, good fps, decent keyboard and mostly just decent all around HOWEVER it gets incredibly hot. So hot, that it ruined components inside of it and right now i have mine getting repaired. There was absolutely no dust build up, and minimal use (Mainly got it for downtime at work, only time it is used is 2 or 3 times a week for a couple hours) And for the current price which is now up like nearly $800 more than when I got it, its an ABSOLUTE waste of money. When using the laptop for anything other than gaming its relatively okay.

"R1ZTB1KP2WTRHK","Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2021",4,"Nice Look - Good Performance For Low Wattage","Note: I bought my laptop for the original $1999 price not the overblown price.First this is a low wattage ""low weight"" laptop for its class. And the GPU is not based off the desktop RTX 3080 but rather a full GA104 chip which I guess comes from the RTX 3070. Not sure though because Nvidia is not clear on this with the laptop chips. It could be a full RTX 3060 chip. Laptop chip specs here if you want to look: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/gaming-laptops/Pros: Strong performing laptop compared to lower end RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 models. Gathering from benchmarks others have done with those models.Other Pros:32GB RAM1TB M.2 SSD (Wish it had 2TB though) -- I did add my own 2TB M.2 SSDIntel 8core/16 Thread CPUNice looking laptopRGB LightingNegatives: Mainly the low wattage which keeps the GPU and CPU from showing their true strengths.Anyway, I really do not have anything to compare this laptop GPU to except my old RTX 2080ti desktop. It doesn't seem to beat it although it is up and down on that front. The low wattage is what keeps this chip down and that is to be expected. But it does have over 6000 CUDA cores so it is beefy in that respect.Do I have buyers remorse? Not really. It does well in gaming at 1080p and 1440p and is not held back by the 8 core Intel chip at all.That being said, I did ramp up as many settings as I could to max out the wattage and power.The laptop comes with the Aorus software to set power to performance and boost the CPU and GPU to max but be wise in your actual needs. The software is a little quirky but after you figure it out it should stay set to where you want it. But don't stop there. Go to the Nvidia control panel in 3D settings and set power management to ""prefer maximum performance"".Also, I have low latency set to Ultra.And resizable bar should be enabled by default although I have no idea if that is helping anything. Especially since Intel chips were not built with that in mind. Where to check: Nvidia control panel then go up top to help then select system info and it should say enabled.I do have an older GTX 1060 laptop with a 6 core Intel chip and it blows that away on all fronts if that helps any.In conclusion for the price I paid I am happy. If you are still worried about that low wattage performance then check out a ""full laptop wattage"" RTX 3070 and that should be fine too. But they come with less storage usually.If you want me to do any specific tests before you buy something like this just ask.

It is extremely easy to use. I set it up & played around with it for a couple of hours, and learned a ton about the ins & outs of the Chromebook.3. A big 'Yay', on the lack of useless bloatware that is so common on Windows systems.4. The touch screen and mouse pad are both very responsive.5. The screen is crystal clear, and I absolutely LOVE the night time blue light filter. It is so much more pronounced than similar filters on any of my other devices. It really helps with eye strain, and you can use it during the day if you want as well.If I think of any more positives as I use it more, I will add updates.And now, for the one glaring flaw that kept me from giving five stars; The keyboard could be much better, visually. The keys are light, and so are the letters. There is not much contrast at all, so the letters/numbers are really hard to see. Luckily, I've been typing for so long that I can get by. But it'd be much easier if I could see the letters without straining!Since I love everything else about it though, I will happily keep it.

Nice speed, great screen, brightness was adequate.Then the weirdest thing happened. I started it up, joined a zoom meeting. Within 20 minutes, the screen froze and it stuttered audibly. I closed the lid, it kept stuttering audibly. The back was hot. I tried to do a hard shutdown, kept stuttering. I tried to do a hard shutdown for a longer time, stuttering. Finally I just kept the power button in for 2 minutes and it finally stopped. It took several hours to cool down. Later I started it up again, and it worked fine. I used it for some documents, light web viewing. Was fine for several weeks.Today, I used it for a zoom meeting again. After the meeting was over, a notification said restart for new update. I clicked restart, screen went black. It never came back on. It is been several hours, I open the lid and it won't come on.

"RGZNNFWYD31DP","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2021",5,"Best chromebook I've used. Perfect for everyday user","The laptop is very well built and doesn't feel cheap. Arguably the best chromebook for the price and features on the market. The keyboard is Back lit and the display is good. The 8gb ram gives it fast response and having 64gb of built in storage is very nice. Gives you plenty of storage for your average user. You can always expand storage with SD card or external hard drive. The battery is very good and touch screen is very responsive. The display is bright and vibrant. With consistent use doing web searching and messing around you will get 8 + hours easy. Charging is fast as well. I did alot of comparison shopping and if you are looking for a laptop for everyday use this is an excellent choice. You can download Microsoft Word and excel free from app store and they work very well. It does take a day or two to get use to the chrome o.s. versus using windows. But, that is expected. It lays flat like a tablet would and automatically turns off keyboard when in the tablet position. The touchscreen is just like using a tablet and response is very good. The camera is decent enough for video calls etc. But probably not as good as newer smart phones offer.I came from a windows o.s background and within a few hours I was use to chrome features and navigation. The apps or ""programs"" are in the task bar which you can be move from bottom left and right side of the screen. At first I was annoyed not being able to move the icons on the home screen as I did with windows machines, but after a while I liked the Taskbar and wasn't bothered at all.To right click you use two fingers at once to click the pad. This threw me off at first. I kept trying to click the right side of the pad with no luck until I looked that up. Just an FYI if you're new to chromebook. But, you get use to that quickly. Overall I'd give it a 9/10. I am fairly tech savvy and needed a laptop for email, web surfing, and other basic needs. This was perfect for me and does everything I need a computer to do fast and efficiently.

"R3BBRLYMC7FCZD","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2021",3,"Underwhelming","Purchasing this laptops is another testament to the fact that good specs don't always amount to a great product. I was deciding between the Gigabyte 17"" and a MacBook Pro 16"" and finally picked the AERO because of it's impressive screen and graphics card. Needles to say I'm experiencing buyers remorse.The Bad:Horrible webcam/nosecam: I don't know why Gigabyte decided to even include this monstrosity. It's completely useless as it gives everyone in your Zoom meeting a detailed look up your nostrils. The cam is mounted in the body so it's not adjustable unless you raise the entire laptop. In the world of remote work a good, usable webcam is a MUST. Dishing out 2500 bucks and realizing that you still need to by an additional webcam to mount on your screen is a joke. GIGABYTE PLEASE FIX.Charging port: It’s located on the right, middle of the laptop which interferes with your mouse, if you have a tight space and are right-handed. Most coffee shops I go to have tiny tables and given the size of this 17.3” laptop there’s very little room.Battery life: I’m a graphic designer that works in 3D occasionally. When I use Photoshop/Illustrator and Dimension I can’t get more than 1 hour of battery life out of this thing even in power saver mode.Screen changes brightness: Yes, it will go darker or lighter without you touching any settings. Not the end of the world, but annoying.Screen goes black: I’ve used this laptop for a month and so far I’ve had at least 5 instances where the screen goes completely black for a second or two. Gigabyte WTF?Annoying keyboard: I’m used to Macs where to change volume you hit F11 or F12. In this thing you have to hold down the Function key in order to adjust volume, so it becomes a two handed operation. I find this really annoying as volume setting is something that is the most adjusted function and needs to be as intuitive as possible.RGB keyboard: This is a Creator’s laptop not a “gamer” laptop. Having the keyboard pulse like a rainbow on acid is not only distracting but also extremely tasteless. If you want to compete with Macbooks please get rid of this gimmick that appeals to 12 year olds.Now the Good:This thing is fast.The screen is beautiful.The GPU kicks ass. It’s 10 times (10!) faster at rendering 3D than my 13” Macbook pro.It’s relatively slim and not too cheesy looking (minus the RGB keyboard) which fortunately you can turn off.About $2500 cheaper than a similarly spec’d out Mac. Mac’s however have better ergonomics.Ports. Useful, but because of its shortcomings I have to use up one USB port for an external cam and another for a mouse. So it’s a mixed bag.Summary:This laptop is good if you keep it plugged in all the time and use it like a desktop. Hauling it around and working on the go is not a real option as you only have about an hour. Gigabyte needs to put more into their product usability testing.",true,1,16,"115","B093Z1PWCF","laptop gigabyte aorus",true,2099,"USD",2499,400,16.01,12,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z1PWCF","44.40",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 17 HDR XD - 17.3"" UHD 4k IPS Anti-Glare, Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, 16GB R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vGsA5sVuS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The 16gb that comes with is probably good enough for the average user.. but I'd recommend atleast upgrading it to 32gb eventually.It is very quite when doing websearching, youtube watching, Autocad or even video/photo editing.When my son used it for minecraft, you can start hearing the fans spin after the laptop starts heating up.... nothing too loud though.(2 Month Update, Final update unless something happens)So after using it for a couple months I realized when using the Laptop on battery once in a while the screen would flash black randomly. This is easily fixed by updating the Intel graphics driver to the newest (As of this review the newest version is: 30.0.100.9805).One more thing for people that have problems with the keyboard settings not staying... update the Gigabyte Control Panel. For me, that fixed it and my keyboard lights up how I selected every startup.Everything else is working great and as expected!I really love this laptop!",true,1,16,"115","B093Z1PWCF","laptop gigabyte aorus",true,2099,"USD",2499,400,16.01,12,3.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z1PWCF","44.40",false,false,false,false,"GIGABYTE AERO 17 HDR XD - 17.3"" UHD 4k IPS Anti-Glare, Intel Core i7, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Laptop GPU 8GB GDDR6, 16GB R...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vGsA5sVuS._AC_UY218_.jpg"
