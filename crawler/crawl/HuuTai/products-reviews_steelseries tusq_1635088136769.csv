They don’t stay quite as cool around the ears as the Hyper X Cloud II, but I can wear them for hours without any heat discomfort. The way the frame works/adjusts around the head let’s it fit snuggly without putting too much pressure which is great for comfort. That also means that it doesn’t give as bad of headphone hairdo (though it still leaves a minor impression on the hair). If you are on PlayStation or PC you can connect it to your system through the USB which adds the nice option of being able to mute your mic and adjust the volume of yourself and of your game. When I play on Xbox I just connect the headphone jack directly to my controller through a headset adapter (which is no longer in production from Microsoft, but it is great and gives the option to mute)As far as mic quality, it’s pretty great, voice goes through nice and crisp and the noise gate on the mic is really effective at preventing unwanted sounds (AC, breathing, etc.) from being picked up.One of the best headsets I’ve ever had.",true,1,6,"16","B08NSVZHXK","steelseries tusq",true,89.99,"USD",149.99,60,40,232,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NSVZHXK","1044.00",false,false,false,false,"HyperX Cloud Revolver - Gaming Headset with HyperX 7.1 Surround Sound, Signature Memory Foam, Premium Leatherette, Steel F...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ah0Nj7McL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The Bluetooth seems to work well with Macs. If you are planning on gaming with them then go pick up a cheaper pair of something because you cannot have nice audio (speakers) & voice-chat (headset) at the same time due to the way the codecs are setup for Bluetooth.

After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,13,"113","B08176SM7C","steelseries tusq",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split Trigger Buttons...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

I had this headset for 3+ years and just recently ordered another one (the old one isn’t broken it’s just kinda gross from so much use - around 3+ hours a day)This headset has amazing sound localization, the frame and cord are both super durable, and comfort is superb from my experience. They don’t stay quite as cool around the ears as the Hyper X Cloud II, but I can wear them for hours without any heat discomfort. The way the frame works/adjusts around the head let’s it fit snuggly without putting too much pressure which is great for comfort. That also means that it doesn’t give as bad of headphone hairdo (though it still leaves a minor impression on the hair). If you are on PlayStation or PC you can connect it to your system through the USB which adds the nice option of being able to mute your mic and adjust the volume of yourself and of your game. When I play on Xbox I just connect the headphone jack directly to my controller through a headset adapter (which is no longer in production from Microsoft, but it is great and gives the option to mute)As far as mic quality, it’s pretty great, voice goes through nice and crisp and the noise gate on the mic is really effective at preventing unwanted sounds (AC, breathing, etc.) from being picked up.One of the best headsets I’ve ever had.",true,1,16,"116","B08NSVZHXK","steelseries tusq",true,89.99,"USD",149.99,60,40,232,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NSVZHXK","1044.00",false,false,false,false,"HyperX Cloud Revolver - Gaming Headset with HyperX 7.1 Surround Sound, Signature Memory Foam, Premium Leatherette, Steel F...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ah0Nj7McL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Software is intuitive for the most part and easy to setup. Software can be buggy sometimes when trying to launch the application but a simple fix for me was to end the services related to the app and re launch. Discord integration is a nice feature but could be improved upon with more option for specific notifications and a setting for longer display of said notifications. Also display is to narrow and at an angle for you to read. Notifications don’t seem to fully display only the beginning part of a message. The weight of the mouse is a turn off. I purchased this with the intent of capitalizing on the features but I was hugely disappointed. Tactical feedback is weak on highest setting making the build feel cheap especially considering the weight of this mouse. The on board memory is somewhat bugged. For example if I set button 4 to mouse button 1 and toggle repeat my clicks won’t register on button 1 or button 4 so I have to open the software reconfigure the settings. It might work for sometime but then the issue happens again and when I start the software it shows some my bindings have changed even though I have all of my profiles duplicated on board. So on board memory and software integration is a inconsistent at best. For example toggle hold works fine for me but repeat on hold does nothing.

You then plug that aux output into the headsets in-line controller, and that controller then ends with a USB plug. That in-line controller controls the 7.1 surround sound, volume, and mute controls. So in theory, yes, you can plug this in to an Xbox controller via the 3.5 aux tip and use the headset. However, you will not have any volume controls, mute option, or 7.1 surround sound. Xbox doesn't even support 7.1 surround sound by the way.Save yourself some money, and buy a wired headset with in line controls that is designed for Xbox.
