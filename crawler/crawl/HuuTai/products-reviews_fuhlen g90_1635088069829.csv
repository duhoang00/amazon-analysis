After that it worked with my Glorious coiled cable. Mine is a USB-C all though the ad does still show micro usb in their photos.The RK software does absolutely nothing for me, neither does the firmware download. It's a pain to get it to even download and when it does open it just shows a keyboard with absolutely no options to choose from or anything.. it literally does nothing. Also the shortcutslike (FN+||) and what not for changing to the ""17"" lighting modes does nothing, neither does the shortcut for brightness. So I am stuck with a mediocre lit blue LED's with no customization.Overall the keyboard looks nice and it'll be probably more of a piece of my display than using it. Would change out the clicky keys, they are a bit much..Pros are it is cheap, looks decent, can take 3 or 5 pin switches and is hot swappable. I think it could use some new stabilizers though.

A non-removable palm rest. And idk bout y'all but when I game, it's in the pitch black darkness. I need backlit keys or light of some kind! I'm good on this one. Returned and getting the 915 with beautiful clicky keys.And since I got the combo. the MX Master is not a BAD mouse either... it's ergonomically fitting to my hand, a nice change to the sometimes too-small gaming mice that Logitech designs for my bigger hands.. But the side scroll is defunct and the forward/back buttons are literally on top of each other in a diagonal fashion. This makes it very tough to hit the correct button the first time. Worst of all however is the fact the polling rate is only 125hz. They say you miss 100% of the shots you don't take.. well with this mouse you can take 100 shots and miss a damn well lot of them due to the low rate. Again, returning this as well and getting the G502 wireless.Logitech needs to rethink their branding for this keyboard/mouse. You can even see from a lot of the reviewers here, this is ideally an OFFICE keyboard/mouse setup. Not a gaming setup! The gaming equivalents are the G915 keyboard and G502 or G903 or G604 or G703 or.. y'know what? There's a lot of good logitech gaming mice out there.. But just 1 (wireless) gaming keyboard by logitech worth it's price.",true,1,9,"18","B07796MBJ7","fuhlen g90",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,3997,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07796MBJ7","17986.50",false,false,false,false,"Logitech G613 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Multihost 2.4 GHz + Blutooth Connectivity - Black","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xNbcWbvDL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
"R3B3X1IIVK5OKJ","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021",2,"Bought 2, switches went bad in both, manually soldering in new switches is a pain!","The first keyboard I purchased started having bad switch issues about 3 months in. The switches would routinely duplicate the letters, and at one point even the backspace key failed (same style switch). Thankfully the switches are replaceable with a little soldering skill, but this is a real nuisance. Because I was in a rush (and thinking Logitech may have just gotten a bad batch of switches during assembly), I bought a second keyboard, identical model, different batch. STILL having switch failures. On the original keyboard I have now replaced a total of EIGHT switches, on the newer one I've had to replace two.Until/unless Logitech gets better switches I would avoid this keyboard. I didn't bother going through customer service because I knew I could repair this issue myself, but not everyone has the tools or is handy. If you're handy and don't mind replacing switches, I've otherwise enjoyed the keyboard. Keystrokes are nice, responsiveness is excellent, and the range of the wireless is great. But c'mon Logitech, for the cost of this keyboard I shouldn't be having switch issues.

YouTube video reported.There were some negative reviews, but there are almost always at least some.If they're less than 10% especially, and if the 5-star ratings are substantially high, I will usually try the product and I generally end up satisfied.The YouTube video STRESSED following instructions for installation and use with 3rd party software, which I followed step by step.The fact that the instructions weren't written by the company itself should not be held against the product, but I found it rather difficult to follow the instructions despite having been a general class amateur radio license holder for many years, with considerable familiarity with electronics in general.I was highly disappointed.I may have gotten a single defective unit, but I decided to return it and not bother with a replacement.Amazon was outstanding with an almost immediate refund as soon as the UPS Store registered their receipt of the product for return.Amazon is GREAT in that regard!First, the device was extremely(!) hot!I could only barely stand to hold it in my hand for more than a few moments to remove it from the computer.I cannot believe that's standard, and if it is, I don't believe it's properly designed.One of the major reasons for failure of electronics is heat - and this is quite excessive in my opinion and experience.Second, despite good familiarity with antenna theory and significant attempts to maximize the antenna tuning to the desired frequency of reception, I was never able to tune in ANY stations outside of the usual FM Radio broadcast band beginning at 88.0 mhz.No lower, no higher frequencies that just that band.I can listen to other FM radios in my home without spending nearly $50 for this.Again, I may have had a faulty unit based on many of the reviews, but decided it wasn't worth another try, at least with this brand.And in any case, be prepared to do some study about antenna design and characteristics as well as getting some software that will properly tune everything together (antenna and this product).I was excited about this, and hoped for far more.Yes, I am indoors with it, but others report far better results indoors, and I placed the antenna right next to an outside window with almost nothing nearby to provide interference (which I didn't seem to be picking up anyway with the receiver.Your mileage may vary, in all fairness.",true,1,12,"111","B011HVUEME","fuhlen g90",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,3672,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011HVUEME","16524.00",false,false,true,false,"RTL-SDR Blog V3 R820T2 RTL2832U 1PPM TCXO HF Bias Tee SMA Software Defined Radio with Dipole Antenna Kit","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71+A7O72aCL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I tried getting used to pressing fn and tilde and got pretty acceptable but still I have to take my hand off the mouse and press an extra button or use a mouse button to remap to fn just to exit a flipping menu. Its doubly frustrating because esc is one of my favorite keys. Ok you can call me wierd, but I am wierder than that! I use alt for crouch so there!

"RTZ1UU0TCB7KO","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",2,"Who designed these key faces??!","I used a K70 with brown switches for a few years before it finally kicked the bucket during a move and I decided to throw down some real cash on a new one. While I like the low-profile approach to this keyboard, whoever decided to not only NOT illuminate the shift characters but also flip their position on the key faces is an absolute imbecile and should not have any say on designing a keyboard in this price range. That kind of design decision is something I expect out of the junk keyboards I get when purchasing refurbished computers for my company...not an $185 gaming keyboard.All that said, outside the lighting and stupid character layout decision, the rest of the keyboard works quite nicely. I have a little bit of a ""springy"" sound on my ""s"" key that's been there since day-1 but otherwise no hardware issues to speak of.Software wise, it's really annoying to have to use G-hub constantly if you want this keyboard to be really functional. I say that because without G-hub running the keyboard defaults to a pattern where it flashes all the colors in a big wave which gets incredibly distracting in your peripherals. If you turn off lighting entirely the same idiot that designed these key faces decided to do dark grey on black. It doesn't impact myself as I've spent 8hr+ a day on a keyboard for 15yrs now but if you don't know how to memory type you're going to be up the creek without G-hub running and you're really going to hate finding those rare shift characters.If you're someone just starting out coding this keyboard is especially not for you, you're basically going to be chicken pecking like your dad because you can't see a thing.",true,1,16,"115","B085RLZ1C4","fuhlen g90",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,5355,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RLZ1C4","25168.50",false,false,false,false,"Logitech G915 TKL Tenkeyless Lightspeed Wireless RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Low Profile Switch Options, Lightsync RG...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V2O4vbYhL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
