This is not a knock against them, as every other product of theirs I've bought (which is many) has served me well, but the G610 was failing earlier than expected. So I needed a new keyboard.Every Corsair product I've ever bought significantly exceeded my expectations. This naturally causes my expectations to rise still further, and this keyboard still beat them. The Cherry Speed switches are quieter than what my last keyboard had, which I love. The required pressing force and travel to actuate them are quite light, which is great for extended use to prevent finger fatigue. Just make sure you're able to only hit the keys you want to press. Accidental actuation is possible.It's noticeably narrower than my G610. I've reclaimed about 3 inches of width on my desk. The spacebar is textured for some reason, but it's fine with me. So is the removable wrist rest, which makes a little more sense. There are 3 brightness settings, plus off. The brightest should be easily visible unless you're standing in direct sunlight at midday. The dimmest won't be irritating in a darkened room.It has a USB pass-through, which requires plugging in a second cable. This is optional and the keyboard will work just fine with only the one cable plugged in (make sure it's the right one; they are labeled). It comes with several replacement keys, and a tool to help replace keys.I did not want to spend $200 on their newest flagship board.

With all the not so good reviews, especially about the screen, I hesitated for a long time before to buy it but when I got some money as a gift from a aunt I decided to try it.First of all, the device looks very good quality and it sticks very well to my K95. The buttons and widgets are easy to setup with iCUE and you can configure them as you like (color, size, background image, etc.). You can only set 6 buttons per screen but you can set as many screens as you want and it's easy to switch between them by swiping with your finger. I switched from a two monitors setup to a single 32"" one a year ago and I was missing very much to be able to monitor my temperatures while gaming without having to run some overlay programs. Turns out that thing does it wonderfully well.Unlike some other people said I didn't notice any increase of CPU usage after I connected it (but maybe it's because my Ryzen 5900x just doesn't feel it).About the screen, it's true that if you look at it from an angle you don't see anything anymore but... this thing is not supposed to be looked at from a 45 degree angle. It is supposed to be watched when you are in front of your keyboard and when you do that it's amazingly clear and bright. My only negative point is that the touch functionality when you press a button is not always super reactive but I realize that it works fine if you aim more toward the bottom of the screen instead of the top. In that way it works just fine.Overall, it's an expansive device but for me it worth it. Really awesome gadget to have in your setup.",true,1,7,"16","B09C1KN1V4","corsair k100",true,289.98,"USD",329.98,40,12.12,459,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C1KN1V4","1927.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair iCUE Nexus Companion Touch Screen – 5” Diagonal Screen – 6 Programmable Virtual Macro Buttons + K100 RGB Optical-M...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41zoZnkeGyL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R1FRW9RUUQ0DB1","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",2,"Great initially, but not built to last","I bought this keyboard in November of 2018. I am a casual gamer, and I really enjoyed the bright colors and the Cherry MX Speed keys. I have never had a keyboard with dedicated macro keys before, and the keyboard itself seemed quite sturdy.Fast-forward to today, and I am having some annoying difficulties with this keyboard that others have noted in the reviews. It does not happen every time, but often when I try to type an ""A"" it ends up writing ""AA"" or ""AAA"". It does not happen every time I press the button either, which only makes it more annoying. As another reviewer noted, this seems to be due to using WASD keys more than the others.In addition, I find that the spacebar is difficult to use in some games. Unless I perfectly hit it in the middle on every press, it will over time begin to slope downward to the left (when my left hand is on WASD my thumb naturally falls just left of the center of the spacebar). This eventually results in the spacebar not registering all of my presses until I press down on the right side and get it back to level.Lastly, switching between users on my computer often causes the keyboard software to glitch and refuse to work until I unplug the USB and plug it back in.None of these issues seem like major concerns, but I bought this keyboard thinking that it would last longer than 3 years.

My major problem with this keyboard is the keys start to break.The plastic that makes up the cross pattern that connects the key to the keyboard seems to be very weak. Within about 2 months or so of owning it, the left side control key broke. To Corsairs credit they sent me a replacement key very quickly, but a few months after that the right control key started to come loose.What I have noticed is it is the keys that are around the edge of the keyboard that have the issue. What I believe it to be is it is the keys that you aren’t pressing at a straight up and down, it is the keys that you are reaching over to with your pinky fingers that are really the problem. I have a feeling overtime they would all start to break down, but the ones that are getting more pressure at an angle are just breaking first.Long story short, I replacing this and going back to my trusted Logitech keyboard because, while their customer service was great, I can’t be waiting for replacement keys every couple months.If this is primarily used for gaming and not a combination of day-to-day and gaming I would say it will last you a while, but if you’re thinking about getting this for your day-to-day I wouldn’t recommend it.",true,1,8,"17","B01N5IISXY","corsair k100",true,159.59,"USD",199.99,40.4,20.2,5028,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5IISXY","23128.80",false,false,false,false,"Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - 6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Fast...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71niQiKL9lL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

B: Go to settings in Icue and force update the firmware. even though you are currently on that firmware you have to force update it so it starts working again. While this is a rather simple fix.

"RTZ1UU0TCB7KO","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",2,"Who designed these key faces??!","I used a K70 with brown switches for a few years before it finally kicked the bucket during a move and I decided to throw down some real cash on a new one. While I like the low-profile approach to this keyboard, whoever decided to not only NOT illuminate the shift characters but also flip their position on the key faces is an absolute imbecile and should not have any say on designing a keyboard in this price range. That kind of design decision is something I expect out of the junk keyboards I get when purchasing refurbished computers for my company...not an $185 gaming keyboard.All that said, outside the lighting and stupid character layout decision, the rest of the keyboard works quite nicely. I have a little bit of a ""springy"" sound on my ""s"" key that's been there since day-1 but otherwise no hardware issues to speak of.Software wise, it's really annoying to have to use G-hub constantly if you want this keyboard to be really functional. I say that because without G-hub running the keyboard defaults to a pattern where it flashes all the colors in a big wave which gets incredibly distracting in your peripherals. If you turn off lighting entirely the same idiot that designed these key faces decided to do dark grey on black. It doesn't impact myself as I've spent 8hr+ a day on a keyboard for 15yrs now but if you don't know how to memory type you're going to be up the creek without G-hub running and you're really going to hate finding those rare shift characters.If you're someone just starting out coding this keyboard is especially not for you, you're basically going to be chicken pecking like your dad because you can't see a thing.",true,1,13,"112","B085RFFC9Q","corsair k100",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,5355,4.7,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085RFFC9Q","25168.50",false,false,false,false,"Logitech G915 TKL Tenkeyless Lightspeed Wireless RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Low Profile Switch Options, LIGHTSYNC RG...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61V2O4vbYhL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Then about a week ago, an issue started where I'd hit the ""r"" key and would repeat two or three times with only a single press. After reaching out for help, they explained it may need cleaned. I do not eat anything near my keyboard and have never spilled anything on my desk, so figured this was unlikely but decided to try anyway. I pulled the key off, saw nothing on the board nor within the key itself, used canned air just in case, put it back together, and the same issue.If cleaning didn't work, the second option was to force the keyboard into ""CRP_Disabled"" drive and sent me files to replace the firmware.bin.

The purpose was to get a nice full sized board with silent linear switches to replace another small board I was using.The first problem to occur was a constant key spam issue. Support was helpful and RMA'd the unit. The process was archaic and a pain to complete. Requiring RMA numbers all over the box, and a paper trail explaining the issue and why RMA was the resolution. FedEx was way more helpful with the shipping process and getting everything sorted out.Took a week or two to get a new board from Hong Kong which wasn't too slow for the distance. The replacement board immediately had an issue with the Numpad 8 key being chipped on the inside probably from a manufacturing issue. Razer's solution is to replace the entire board for a singular keycap. This is pretty unfortunate and I will just be picking up a custom set of caps.

"R2LZT110IV9KJI","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",1,"Horrible battery life, bad connections","I was excited to receive this keyboard.I had been watching it for a while and finally decided to buy it.It is not cheap, and being a Razer product, I was expecting something really good.Instead, I am returning the keyboard due to really poor performance.After I received the keyboard I immediately removed it from the packaging and plugged it in so it would charge.Once fully charged, I kept the keyboard plugged in via the supplied USB cable to do the setup and customization.I did not want to drain the battery at all during this processes.Once everything was setup, I ""Synced"" the keyboard to the computer using the supplied 2.4 GHz Hyperspeed Dongle.Once all setup was complete, I disconnected the USB cable so I could use it wirelessly.My first issue with the keyboard is how loud it is.I did my research on this keyboard before buying it and selected the Yellow keys - ""silent and linear"".I fully understand mechanical keys are not perfectly silent, but this is the loudest keyboard I have ever used, and I have been in the technology field for a long time, so I have used some old mechanical keyboards.This is the least of my issues with the keyboard, as this could possibly be ignored, but it was an issue, so I wanted to make sure to get it out there that this is a LOUD keyboard.My second issue was the connection.This keyboard would lose connection at times when using the ""Hyperspeed"" connection.I would have to patiently wait a while for it to connect again, or turn the keyboard off and back on again.Please note, the computer is only about 3 feet away from the keyboard with nothing obstructing the signal between the two items.I decided to try the Bluetooth connection...no luck.My computer has no problem detecting other Bluetooth devices, no matter what the device is, the age, or the brand.However, my computer could never ""find"" this keyboard.I even tried making sure it was the only Bluetooth device in the area turned on, and it still never found it.So, my only course of action was to plug the ""wireless"" keyboard in with the supplied USB cable to ensure I would not lose connection with the computer.My third issue.Not sure how to describe this, but it would randomly do things.After having the wireless keyboard plugged in as a wired keyboard (if you can't tell I am frustrated about this, I am), I would be typing and it would randomly open the start menu or task manager.Other times it would just randomly throw up a string of letters that I didn't type.I am not sure how this happened, and only happened a few times before I decided to box this up and start the return process, but it was weird and random.I have never seen that before with.My final issue, and perhaps the most important was the battery life.As I indicated earlier I let the keyboard fully charge before using, and I kept it plugged in while doing the initial setup.I had the keyboard unplugged and working as a wireless keyboard for maybe a little over an hour before reconnecting to become a wired keyboard.Of course, during that time I had the lights going and was using it as a normal keyboard (not gaming, just internet and email) and of course fighting the connection issues.When I pugged the keyboard back in and went back into the Razer Synapse application, I noticed the battery charge had dropped to 76%.WHAT?!?!?!In just over an hour the battery was drained 24%?This is ridiculous.The keyboard I was replacing (and now using for this review) is a wireless backlit keyboard that only needs to be charged once every few months.This keyboard would not even make it through a full day using it as designed with lights active.I could not imagine anyone using this for gaming as it would surely die before the game is finished.So my options now were to either leave the keyboard plugged in, which defeats the purpose of buying a wireless keyboard (and deal with the weird random letters and opening of other applications); or turning the light effects off to save battery life, which defeats the purpose of buying an expensive RGB keyboard.Either way, I would not get what I paid a lot of money for.So, I am returning the keyboard.",true,1,17,"116","B08FQTK1RW","corsair k100",true,179.99,"USD",229.99,50,21.74,682,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FQTK1RW","2932.60",false,false,false,false,"Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro Mechanical Wireless Gaming Keyboard: Green Mechanical Switches - Tactile & Clicky - Chroma RGB Lig...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RyDhL6FjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R29NH6RU20KFL7","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2021",1,"Stopped Connecting to Anything After Just 2 Months of Use","I got this keyboard to replace a Huntsman optical that overall was doing great, but I had an issue with the volume knob (which I use quite regularly) and for me it wasn't the best tying experience for working and gaming. I needed a keyboard that was a little more clicky as I was accidentally hitting other keys with the very short travel of the Huntsman optical. I also wanted wireless so I could pair my work laptop via bluetooth and either connect via a cable or dongle with my personal computer.The Blackwidow V3 Pro at first was amazing. Connected quickly and reliably, the typing experience was much better for my work, the volume knob worked great unlike my Huntsman optical, and the RGB matched perfectly with my other peripherals, and I was in heaven.Then the 2-3 key presses started happening. This wasn't something I noticed with a lot of reviews when I purchased this, but looking back this is a huge problem with this keyboard. This is very problematic depending on what type of game you're playing or if you're pulling double duty and using this keyboard for work. Constantly editing emails or documents was getting very old.I also ran into connection issues after just a month. At first it was just not connecting to bluetooth as quickly, but then if I was using the 2.4Ghz dongle on my personal rig during a game, it would just cut out. It was 3 feet away and within perfect line of sight. Then it got so bad I had to just start plugging it in to game because of random disconnects. It also started randomly flashing the lights.Then today it just stopped connecting to anything. Won't connect to bluetooth, the 2.4ghz dongle or a wired connection. It won't pair with anything new but I was able to reset it and then update the firmware. Then it registers with Synapse if I have it plugged in, but it is still not usable at all. No key presses will register. Also if I press keys while it's connected via the USB cord, it will do random colors like rainbow wave, or do green pulse from where I push the key. The keyboard is entirely useless now after just 2 months.Do not buy this keyboard, or if you do, get a warranty. This is the 2nd Razer keyboard in a row that's had problem. I've typically loved the feel of Razer products, but $500 of peripherals that have either had issues or bit the dust in 2 years is too much.

There are so many better options for your keyboard!","This BEST part of Corsair's newest generation of keyboards is they now use a standard bottom row. This means that you can put almost any keycap set you want on your fancy new keyboard and really make it your own one of a kind keyboard. You are no longer beholden to Corsair's proprietary first party keycap sets. Which is a good thing because these Corsair key caps kind of suck.I've posted some pictures of my K65 keyboard to show what I mean. You can see that the light bleed on these keycaps is just terrible. The red keys in the picture are corsair and the white and blue keycaps are from a third party (drop, I think). On the red switches the entire area around the lettering glows meaning that they are thin in that area. The white switches the only theletter lights up more without the bleed. This is especially true with higher brightness levels and colors closer to white. On the red keycaps when the RGB is set to pure white the color comes through as a deeper pink. The same could be said of the blue third party caps, but it's not nearly as bad.On the upside these keycaps feel good and will fit just about any keyboard, but you can spend the same money and get a much better keycap from places like Drop, Ducky, HyperX or just about anywhere else.Do yourself a favor- look elsewhere.",true,1,20,"119","B0919MMLK4","corsair k100",false,29.99,"USD",0,0,0,926,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0919MMLK4","4259.60",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR PBT Double-Shot PRO Keycap Mod Kit – Double-Shot PBT Keycaps – Origin Red – Standard Bottom Row – Textured Surface...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Vcm4zPnYS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Going to likely and painfully return this horrible product especially after hearing this happen to others.Edit: this product is the most frustrating experience, nothing lights up properly and customer service told me I had to play email tag because their “tech support” doesn’t cover troubleshooting this and the people that do only answer by email. Sometimes 2 fans light up, other times just one but never all 3 and nothing else in the kit has ever lit up as intended. Stay away.This product comes in great packaging and you really feel like you got value for money especially when you tally up the individual items.It’s also not the cheapest, but I wanted to get something higher quality being my first time and all, but this wasn’t quite the case.To begin I learned the pipes were called something that’s just a fancy word for acrylic, and I learned very fast that it’s not very forgiving and easy to mess up. Couple that with the types of adapters you get which pretty much commit you to hardline tubing and you are stuck either with attempting to use them (and in my case immediately messing up a tube despite watching videos prior,) or investing a lot more money to get better tubes or different adapters, but it doesn’t end there…It comes with a squeeze container for filling the pump which broke off inside just from using, that was 2 hours of draining and playing rubik’s cube trying to get out, not fun. But it doesn’t end there either…The pump is awkward as heck, if you have it all plugged in the thing doesn’t operate at full power when filling and you are stuck trying to figure out why the tubes aren’t filling, why does it gotta be like that?The directions aren’t the best, and this process was very painful, I got coolant all over my motherboard and cards despite my best intent to cover everything which yes, is part to user error but I also feel the acrylic isn’t the best use and I wish there were more options from Corsair like being able to buy a kit with soft tubing.

I did purchase some extra 90 degree fittings just in case I needed them and with my case being an itx I definitely needed them.i changed the rad to a 240 since the 360 was not able to fit in my case. As far as temps, I have a ryzen 5 3600 with an aorus 3090 wb card. Temps for my gpu never got over 70 and my cpu was the same. I do think the fans included with this are ment for a bigger case. My overall build went smooth and I had more than enough tubing(had 3 sticks left so only used half of what was included). Definitely a good buy if your a beginner like me!Update: I was getting high temps on my cpu. And by high it was 83c after playing 1 game of warzone. I re-seated and reapplied thermal paste to the cpu plate and still no change. After trying for a second time to re-seat it I decided to remover the washer on the mounting screws that the instruction say to put on. (I included a pic of the instructions.)
