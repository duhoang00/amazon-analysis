"R12ZP43LF7BB99","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2021",4,"Good, But Could Be Better","I upgraded to this from the Corsair HS35 because I wanted a wireless headset so that I wouldn't have to remove the headset and miss out on stuff every time I had to step away.The order arrived completely intact and without incident the day after I placed my order.I tested it out immediately, and I have been using it consistently for about a week now.It definitely serves its intended purpose (to give me a wireless option).The range on it is pretty good.I am able to walk all around the ground floor of my house and even walk outside my front door to pickup deliveries and still maintain connection.However, sometimes the connection is spotty, regardless of how far away I am from my computer, including sometimes if I am sitting right in front of it.I notice that sometimes, as I am walking away from the computer, if I move to fast, it takes time for it to catch up, so it's kind of in-and-out.But whenever I have such connection issues, usually if I power it down, remove the dongle from the USB port, re-insert it, and turn the headphones back on, the connection issues disappear.Some other things that I dislike about this:1.Size:it is adjustable, but even at its smallest, it is still a little loose on my head (for reference, my hat size is 7 1/2, although that doesn't exactly translate to a headset).While the HS35 fits perfectly, because these are a little loose, the band doesn't sit on top of my head, so my ears are really the only thing supporting it, and pretty often I can feel it slipping down on my ears, so I have to adjust it.2.When I did some testing, the recordings I did with this mic were not as clear and crisp as the ones I did with the HS35 mic.The speakers, however, seem to be pretty comparable.Other than the freedom of a wireless headset, one thing that I did like about this is that it comes with it's own windscreen, which is pretty important to me because there is a lot of background noise in the room where I use it.The windscreen does a good job filtering out the background noise.And because it comes with one, it is a perfect fit.The HS35 did not come with one, so I had to by some separately (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EJ0N5FS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which do not fit perfectly, and fall off frequently.Overall, I am pleased with Corsair HS70.For the price, you will not find a better wireless headset.Overall, I like the HS35 better, but the freedom that the wireless HS70 provides is definitely enough to make it my primary headset for the time being.I am giving it 4 stars, but it's probably more like a 3.5.I went back and forth between 3 and 4, but in the end, I felt 3 was a little too harsh.So, yes.Four stars, but really more like a 3.5.",true,1,2,"11","B07X9W721J","corsair hs",true,79.99,"USD",99.99,20,20,3479,4.3,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9W721J","14959.70",false,false,false,false,"Corsair HS70 Pro Wireless Gaming Headset - 7.1 Surround Sound Headphones for PC, MacOS, PS5, PS4 - Discord Certified - 50m...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XjjJovijL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Before the end-of-January, I had to send them back cut to a component failure. As shown in the pictures, they use a plastic cover piece to secure the headphones and hold them in place with metal screws going into plastic parts. As you adjust the headphones to your head (my wife & son share these) you are constantly re-adjusting to a comfortable fit. This is the problem. I just had my second pair fail, due to the same issue. Only this time around we were ""on guard"", to be extremely careful when adjusting. They failed on me today as I was on a TEAMS Chat conference call. The headset works fantastic. The features are great. Adjustable sound, mute, removable boom mike. All great and work fantastically. BUT, one of the most important components in the build is made from very thin, cheap, plastic. If they would spend just a little more money and use aluminum this problem would be cured. I will never buy another one of their products again.

I purchased them to replace another gaming headset thinking they might be more durable and because they offered some great features (wireless, surround sound, etc.).

But without it the sound eq settings were alright, but with the bass boost setting it somehow kills sound all together making it really quiet.

The Cups feel really comfy and also fit nice around my fat ears!

Plus, I've spent some time playing with the Dolby Atmos software in Windows 10, switching between enhanced Movie and Music modes - and this actually helps a lot to experience surround sound like never before.

"R2NJCXPJ9V2VB3","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",3,"Average sound quality, quiet mic, not that comfortable","I bought into all the YouTube reviews hyping this headset. Bought a pair to see for myself and they didn’t meet expectations. Maybe it was due to all the reviews. The material and aesthetics are good and feel premium, but there were too many downsides for me to keep them.Out of the box sound quality is pretty average at best, with weak bass. Note, I never messed with the EQ settings so it's possible this can be fixed with some tweaking. Games might sound fine and if you don’t care about really good sound quality for anything else.Mic quality is actually really solid, but unfortunately really quiet. I’m sure you can increase it with some software, but Corsair should really fix that on their end. The red LED when the mic is in the mute position can get pretty distracting if on a video conference as there is no way to turn it off.For me, it wasn't super comfortable, although you can probably still wear them for long sessions without issues. I have a medium to large head and the strap is enough for me. It feels a bit too heavy and the clamping force is on the strong side.The on/off button has some issues. At times, it seems like the button doesn't register and you have to press and hold a couple of times on the right position. I even got a replacement thinking it was just that headset, but it had the same issue. I could have lived with it, if not for all the other issues.If you really just need a wireless headset with a good mic and are fine with everything else, this could work for you. I really wanted to like them, but for $150, I personally don’t think it’s worth it with all the downsides. If it was priced around $100, I might have kept them.",true,1,7,"17","B09BBPTDWX","corsair hs",false,149.99,"USD",0,0,0,34,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BBPTDWX","136.00",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR HS80 RGB Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with Spatial Audio - Works with Mac, PC, PS5, PS4 - Carbon","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SzBbPQQeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
"R4K5DDTJXA51Z","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2021",4,"Very impressive!","If I’m being honest, the reviews almost had me running the other direction. I decided to take a leap and give them a shot anyway, and I’m glad I did! I’m a bit of an audiophile and usually rely on a dedicated amp/usb mic/audiophile cans for my gaming needs, but I wanted something wireless that I could also use on my ps5. I’ve tried many other headsets some of which included Jbl Quantum 800s, Steelseries Arctis 7ps, Audeze Penrose, and Beoplay Portals. Although, all of those are good headsets in their own right, something about them that caused me to lose interest and ultimately either return or even sell them for a loss. Generally it was either comfort, connection issues, low volume on console, or poor quality mic that was the leading culprit.Now the HS80s at $150 do everything right while managing to do nothing offensively wrong. They aren’t perfect by any means but what they manage to do at that price point is sound fantastic, have a stable connection, are extremely comfortable, and have the best wireless mic I have ever used. They also work seamlessly on PS5 and get so loud that no person using them would need to go higher than 60%.The only fault I can give these are due to software alone. For people that have used ICUE you already know the issues, but for people that haven’t, it can be particular and require some finesse to get everything working right. One issue I have is every time I turn them on they default to 8 channel audio regardless of them being set to stereo in ICUE. It’s not a huge deal you just go into your sound settings on windows and change it to 2 channel 24 bit 48khz and they sound amazing after that.

"RLYFSK6IKTRUJ","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021",3,"Narrow earcups and very quiet microphone","TLDR the audio is great with light tuning in the EQ and the microphone QUALITY is amazing, but the overall mic volume is too low for me, even with Windows settings maxed out, and the earcups are a tad narrow causing some constant light pressure along the back of my ear, especially if walking around.If the microphone volume was acceptable I could have lived with the earcups.The audio quality out of the box wasn't the best, the mids are a bit too strong and muddle the highs.Messing with the eq and raising the highs gave an amazing sound which is among the best in headsets at this price range, from my experience. The sound is a little richer and cleaner than what I get from my Arctis 7s.The cloth earcups do mean you miss a bit of the bass, but I didn't find the experience lacking since the mids were stronger and helped fill the gap.This headset doesn't offer any 3d audio or surround sound simulations.The microphone was probably the best and worst thing about this headset at the same time.For a wireless headset, the quality of this microphone is ASTOUNDING.I've used a Blue Yeti and AT2020USB as desk microphones in the past and on a purely quality review, this microphone is right there with them for anything but the purest audiophile.Where the microphone suffers is the volume.I'm unsure if my model was defective (due to other concerns below I didn't choose to replace to see and instead did a refund), but even with every mic setting I could find in Windows and the Corsair software maxed out, my friend had to set me to 200% in discord compared to my Arctis 1s or 7s at a normal 100%.If you plan to also use this as a work headset as well, the volume might not be great for zoom or teams calls.I did not test to see how much this microphone could be boosted in OBS capture for streaming.The fit of the headband support is great and the inside adjustments are good if slightly limited, but the earcups were a bit too narrow for me.The memory foam compresses nicely, but when work there was a mild constant pressure against the back of my ears.For normal sitting and gaming it was fine, but since it is wireless, getting up and walking around made it was noticeable for any tiny movements of the headset.Apart from the ears, the overall clamp and fit was perfect though - my Arctis 7 which uses a similar elastic strap system was always too loose for my head and slipped around heavily when walking or bending, but this never seemed at risk of sliding off.",true,1,7,"17","B09BBPTDWX","corsair hs",false,149.99,"USD",0,0,0,34,4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BBPTDWX","136.00",false,false,false,false,"CORSAIR HS80 RGB Wireless Premium Gaming Headset with Spatial Audio - Works with Mac, PC, PS5, PS4 - Carbon","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61SzBbPQQeL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R31EP96A289O2C","Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2021",3,"Some limitations on PC","I bought these to use with a PC and an Xbox wireless adapter which is where my rating comes from.Sound quality and mic quality seemed good.Comfort was great.I loved how these felt while I was wearing them.The earpads were thick and soft.Also, the thing I really liked about this headset when used with the wireless adapter is Windows 10 will recognize when you turn the headset on and change your speaker output to headphones and will switch it back to speakers when you turn the headset off again.This is not something easy to do with any other headset.However, when using this headset on a PC the volume of the headset resets every time you power cycle them.So, every single time you go to use it you have to adjust the volume.Also, the microphone monitoring (sidetone) turns back on if you have previously turned it off every time you power cycle the headset.These two issues are really annoying.There should be a memory setting to keep the volume and mic monitoring where you have it set.I understand mic monitoring can be a useful tool but I do not want to hear myself and my environment coming though my headphones.I am using them to chat in games occasionally and not to stream from or talk into for hours so I just don't want the mic monitoring active and it is annoying turning it off every time I use the headset.I am guessing these are not issues when using the headset on an Xbox but I am using it for PC which is supposed to be a supported use case.The 7.1 surround is even PC exclusive.Also, there is no equalizer settings or anything else you can change when using these on PC.Some of Corsair's cheaper headsets have equalizer settings you can change on PC in the icue software.The only thing you can do on PC with these is update the firmware.It is possible a future firmware could address these issues but I kind of doubt it as I am not sure they are even considered bugs.The reason I believe this is because the volume wheel on these is like an infinite wheel where there is no start or stop point.You can just turn it forever which means some sort of software or programming needs to keep track of where the volume is at rather than the position of the volume wheel like on other headsets.Anyway, there were some nice thing about this headset.The automatic speaker/headset switching is really nice in Windows.I wish all wireless headsets could do that but I believe it is because you are using the Xbox wireless adapter that makes it possible with these.Unfortunately, for the way I want to use a headset the volume and mic monitoring issues are not something I can live with.I would give this a 3.5 out of 5 if I could.",true,1,8,"18","B08JD18Q4Q","corsair hs",false,146.99,"USD",0,0,0,241,4.1,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08JD18Q4Q","988.10",false,false,false,false,"Corsair HS75 XB Wireless Gaming Headset for Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KAi95uo-L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I've had multiple brands of expensive gaming headphones in the past and none of them were as good as these.",true,1,18,"118","B07N85FY1G","corsair hs",true,58.99,"USD",79.99,21,26.25,33129,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N85FY1G","152393.40",false,false,false,false,"Razer Kraken Gaming Headset: Lightweight Aluminum Frame - Retractable Noise Isolating Microphone - For PC, PS4, PS5, Switc...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71APetaWkpL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
