"R1MO3GMYRBW1DC","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2021",4,"A Solid Work Laptop for Office & Travel","As someone who uses a 13"" MacBook Pro as my personal computer, I wanted something comparable for my work set up, which requires the use of Windows to run proprietary applications. The Dell XPS was the closest Windows-based PC that I could find to the MacBook Pro, both in terms of performance and form factor.The Dell has a smaller footprint than my MacBook Pro, which already has a pretty small footprint to begin with. The thinner bezel on the XPS makes the screen look even larger than it is, while also allowing the laptop to be a good bit smaller.The OLED screen on the XPS is very nice, though it can look a little washed out at time. Overall, it's pretty crisp and 4k videos look great. I still prefer the MacBook Pro screen, but I'm not exactly a screen snob. The touch screen seems to do what touch screens do, but I don't ever use it, so I can't say how good or bad it might be on a day-to-day basis. I prefer to keep my hands off my screens.The keyboard on the XPS is nice. There isn't a ton of key travel, but enough that you can at least feel your way around and the likelihood of double-tapping keys by mistake is very slim.Performance-wise, I think it's fine for most of what I do. I believe it is a little weaker in terms of performance than my M1 MacBook Pro, but not by a huge amount. Some applications have trouble opening, Outlook freezes from time-to-time, and I have some hangups with a few Adobe CC programs that I don't get on my M1 Mac, but overall it does what I need it to do at the office.The battery life is pretty weak unless you adjust the slider way down toward the ""best battery life"" section rather than the ""best performance"" section. I understand upping performance sacrifices battery life, but even when I'm not all the way up toward better performance, the battery life takes a major hit.The webcam is trash. I'm just going to be honest. I don't really care, because I don't really do Zoom calls or anything like that, but I am admittedly shocked at how awful it is.I dock the XPS at the office and take it with me when I travel, so it's nice to have such a compact laptop with solid (albeit not elite) performance. I still have only heard the fan come on a handful of times, and it's definitely not loud and I have yet to have my thermals get out of whack. Granted, I'm not exporting 8K videos or anything. But for work tasks, I think it generally handles them well.",true,1,1,"10","B08QN2X5YK","dell g-series",false,1650,"USD",0,0,0,75,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QN2X5YK","330.00",false,false,false,false,"Dell XPS 13 9310 Touchscreen 13.4 inch FHD Thin and Light Laptop - Intel Core i7-1185G7, 16GB LPDDR4x RAM, 512GB SSD, Inte...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91MXLpouhoL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The pen tip is much more durable and precise, the buttons are placed high up enough so that you aren't accidentally pressing them while writing (a problem I had with the Bamboo ink), it has a magnet to hold to your laptop, and a huge perk for me is that this pen takes AAA batteries.

After less than 18 months, I noticed the right hinge was popping out. That lead to me calling Dell and they were of no use, etc. and wanted $160 to analyze it. I called a local computer tech and that led to needing to replace the keyboard. Now I am faced with not being able to close the lid as the hinge issue has caused the screen to fall apart and separate. I have no idea what the repair will be this time and am faced with having to pay for an extensive body repair or buy a replacement computer. I do not recommend this product or if you do buy it, pay for the extended warranty. I have owned this computer since Dec 2018 and have already put more than $200 into it.April 5, 2021 Update: Today's repair was an additional $265. The tech had to replace the laptop body and said that he has never seen such brittle plastic in his 20 years of experience. Not only did all the little rivet's fall out, but three of the hinge screws were broken out of the plastic. What was even more depressing was that the replacement body's screen is not a touch screen as I had before. Overall, do not buy this unit. I have owned or possessed at least 16 Dells over the years via business and personal use. I am not down on Dell, but this laptop really stinks. I have over $900 invested in this laptop now.

"R30KOIF5WF734F","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2021",1,"I've never regretted a purchase more! Do not buy this!","I bought this after reading a review that said it was ""approaching perfection"" - clearly it didn't get very close. I now know that there are multiple extremely disruptive KNOWN flaws to this machine that Dell has not fixed in years of putting out new XPS laptops. Here's a few that I've had with it right out of the box...1) Trackpad wobble. When I first got the computer I thought, this is the wobble they're complaining about? It's nothing! By a month later it was driving me insane.2) Cursor jumps around, disappears, clicks, moves when it shouldn't, etc. When it's doing this, the trackpad is unusable and you have to use an external mouse.3) The screen sometimes turns on at an extremely low brightness, far dimmer than the lowest brightness setting, and it can't be changed by turning it up. You have to turn off the screen and turn it back on again. If you don't catch that it's on (easy because it's so dim) you might end up clicking something trying to get your screen to turn on.4) One of the screws in the back corner needs to be tightened constantly or the screen section will move around.5) Blue screens at least once a week.6) Alt-tab sometimes randomly starts working, fixes with restart but it's irritating to have to do that often.7) Sometimes clicking on icons in the start bar will do nothing.8) Sometimes gets so hot that the surface is uncomfortable to rest my palm on.Another preferential thing is that I really recommend getting a computer with a USB-A port; there are still a lot of things with that plug. For example, pretty much all USB receivers for mouse/keyboard combos come with a USB-A plug. Because of the trackpad issues, the one USB-A port on the included dongle is always taken up with my mouse receiver. I had to buy my own dongle that's really irritating to carry around to accommodate anything else that needs USB-A.Do NOT buy this computer. I wanted it to last me at least 5 years and I'm not sure if I can stand using it for even one. $2000 down the drain.",true,1,18,"117","B089HJX59L","dell g-series",false,2348,"USD",0,0,0,375,4.2,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089HJX59L","1575.00",false,false,false,false,"Dell XPS 15 - 15 Inch FHD+, Intel Core i7 10th Gen, 16GB Memory, 512GB Solid State Drive, Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 Ti 4GB G...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81rsoANm7tL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
