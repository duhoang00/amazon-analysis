Thanks to COVID-19, all mu classes were online and I had to do a Zoom call pretty much every day. However, I noticed that the screen was a little off whenever I connected to a Zoom meeting. Everything, all the letters, all the faces, and all the images were blurred, and I could never fix that problem. I just got used to the idea that if I was connected to Zoom, I couldn’t use any other feature of my laptop. There were times when I needed to search for some information on Google and I had to use my phone because I couldn’t read anything!On top of that, today my laptop decided to shut down completely. I’ve charged it for hours, I’ve been trying to turn it on, everything seems to be fine, but the screen doesn’t turn on! Honestly, this was the worst investment in my life, and and to make it even worse, I had to buy it in the middle of a pandemic that affected my income, just to be able to study! Now I can’t study at all, and now that I found a job, I can’t even work properly because this laptop DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.I’ve only had it for two months, TWO MONTHS. I’ve never dropped it, I take a good care of it, I don’t even have that many documents or apps that could be damaging it somehow. It’s so frustrating to buy a thing that you hope to rely on and it turns to be a complete disaster.This is the second Dell I’ve owned, and the first one decided to die one day and I couldn’t never turn it on again.

After less than 18 months, I noticed the right hinge was popping out. That lead to me calling Dell and they were of no use, etc. and wanted $160 to analyze it. I called a local computer tech and that led to needing to replace the keyboard. Now I am faced with not being able to close the lid as the hinge issue has caused the screen to fall apart and separate. I have no idea what the repair will be this time and am faced with having to pay for an extensive body repair or buy a replacement computer. I do not recommend this product or if you do buy it, pay for the extended warranty. I have owned this computer since Dec 2018 and have already put more than $200 into it.April 5, 2021 Update: Today's repair was an additional $265. The tech had to replace the laptop body and said that he has never seen such brittle plastic in his 20 years of experience. Not only did all the little rivet's fall out, but three of the hinge screws were broken out of the plastic. What was even more depressing was that the replacement body's screen is not a touch screen as I had before. Overall, do not buy this unit. I have owned or possessed at least 16 Dells over the years via business and personal use. I am not down on Dell, but this laptop really stinks. I have over $900 invested in this laptop now.

I have to much money in it to throw it away and I have no children or grandchildren to give it to. I realize that it is my mistake for not researching this purchase properly beforehand. HOWEVER, I would like to meet the IDIOT that designed this keyboard and mouse pad. The keyboard has silver keys in a silver background with white/silver back lighting. Under most conditions you can not see any of the letters/numerals making it very difficult for a lousy typist like me. The mouse pad is large but requires a certain amount of force to operate so the pointer ends up usually any place other than what you want it to be.

Also the 12GB of RAM beats most of the ones in this price range. Aside from certain keys being in less convenient positions, I have had no complaints until today when I realized the Insert key works in that it presses, but it does not toggle the insert mode. It's always in overwrite mode. This feature is probably so rarely used by most users that they thought nobody would notice. However, it would make what I'm working on much easier. I also must hold Fn key to enable home and end keys to work, which is annoying but at least they work.Calling Dell support had me in tears when ""Puneet"" took remote control of my computer and immediately closed the browser window, despite my shouting to not do so. I had numerous tabs open with important work, and he didn't even ask, then said he made a mistake and meant to minimize it. What an idiot. I was not using Chrome (and was panicking) so I had trouble finding the ""recently closed"" option, which thankfully restored my tabs but what a giant tool.Anyway his test failed, meaning the key is defective, and my only option is to mail in the only computer I have right now and be without it for 2-3 weeks. I am sure there must be an easier fix, like some setting is not set correctly, but they want their sweet warranty bucks and tried selling me the premium plan. When I had a Dell in the past, a tech guy came to my home, so it's pretty galling that I'd have to pay $119 to get a defective computer fixed or be without it for weeks. (I didn't ask but assume I'd have to pay to ship it for service, which won't be cheap either.) And $119 is for a lower 1-year warranty that won't cover physical damage; that would cost $169.BTW calling support went south from the start. A voice comes on and says there are numbers on the underside of your device, so enter it now. It gives you about 2 seconds to turn the computer over and scrutinize the label to find the number among the many others. To top it off, my label was all smudged as if it had been damaged by water but stuck on anyway. I had no idea what I was looking for and the automated voice switched me to Sales, then sales switched me to tech support, and I could have easily found this service tag number by going to the Dell support page, which automatically recognizes your device and displays it. So more unnecessary stress.

"R2TBV4L0PWREY3","Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2021",4,"Almost perfect","I've been using this laptop for about a month, and I've only found 3 things that could be improved.1) the keyboard needs backlighting.I'm often working in low light situations and the lack of backlighting makes typing very difficult.I've worked around it by tilting the screen down slightly to help illuminate the keyboard.This is my biggest complaint.2) the SD card should go all the way in when inserted.Instead it only goes in about 1/2 way.This prevents you from inserting the card and leaving it there all the time.3) for some reason the F11 an F12 keys don't default to 'home' and 'end'.You have to use fcn/F11 and fcn/F12 to access those actions.This is probably a setting in configuration somewhere, but I haven't found it yet.Battery life appears to be outstanding.The unit is light and very thin.",true,1,18,"117","B08TBFR4ZB","dell inspiron 2017",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,110,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08TBFR4ZB","506.00",false,false,false,false,"Dell Inspiron 15 3505 Full HD Laptop (FHD), 15.6 inch - AMD Ryzen 5 3450U, 12GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, AMD Radeon Vega 8 Gra...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81syFo9ehwL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
