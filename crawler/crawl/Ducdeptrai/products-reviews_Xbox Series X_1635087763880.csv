They asked if shipping out another battery would be OK or did I want to replace the item or send it back for a refund. Always nice to have options!I took a chance and asked them to ship another battery to me and surprisingly it was at my door a couple of days later... and it worked! The seller even followed up to make sure everything was OK.For such a cheap item (in the scheme of things) I was very impressed by the Customer Service. They obviously stand behind this product... andfor good reason!I've usually bought chargers that provide a door for the XBox controller to charge through and rest in a cradle but I'd just bought a Series X and couldn't find one where the door fitted on the new controllers.

"R1576U767H7T7X","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2021",5,"Advertised speeds with TB3/TB4","Your browser does not support HTML5 video.¬†Strangely, this thing gets better write speeds then my internal Sabrent Rocker Q4 Gene nvme drive. The Sabrent wins in reads bit even when plugged into a TB4 elements hub, I get full speeds as my ASRock Nuc only has 1 TB4 port.I'm currently us√≠ng this as my performance tier drive for windows storage spaces with 2 14TB WD 7200RPM in a simple virtual disk (software RAID0). This has to be configured via PowerShell and is not supported by Microsoft. Essentially anything written to the 25.7TB drive is written to the X5, then the X5 writes the data to the spinning drives in the background. This gets me 1.6GB/s write speeds in bursts, then drop down to 600/500MB/s. It will get a bit slower if you fare copying enough data to fill the X5. Meaning that since I got the 500GB model, speed will start to slow down when transferring over 500GB of data which is rare. You can do this by creating different tiers. Google ""Storage spaces ssd cached drive"" to learn how to set it up this way. If you attempt to do this via the GUI you will just blindly be throwing this in and would be a complete waste.",true,1,21,"121","B07GBWZJFG","Xbox Series X",true,299.99,"USD",349.99,50,14.29,615,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBWZJFG","2767.50",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Samsung X5 Portable SSD - 1TB - Thunderbolt 3 External SSD (MU-PB1T0B/AM) Gray/Red","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WHxWq9liL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

It performs BETTER than using the internal Fusion drive did. I only wish it had been more clear about already coming with a Thunderbolt cable.

"R29FVSR2BKR9JN","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2021",4,"Fast, Nice Design and Construction But Prone to Thermal Throttling","This is a very well made external SSD and for many tasks will perform flawlessly, resulting in fast transfers or 2K video editing, etc. The main problem with this device (and it's common / not specific to Samsung) is that after a few mintues of continuous data transfer or other demanding task, the NVMe drive inside will start to rapidly heat up. When it gets to a certain temperature, the device automatically throttles down to prevent damage to the drive or internal components, then after a few minutes of low use or idle time, it will return to a state where it can deliver top speeds. The best I've seen were over 2200 MB/s write and 2500 MB/s read, but more typically you'll see something like 1200 MB/s write, because of the problem described above. Still faster than a Gen 2 USB drive but a pretty big drop regardless.So if you're looking to use this for highend video editing (feeding raw footage off the drive), you probably will want to look elsewhere. If you just want a really fast backup drive or a working drive for your Photoshop projects or the like, it's great. The main limits will be encountered by video profressionals and scientific computing professionals.",true,1,21,"121","B07GBWZJFG","Xbox Series X",true,299.99,"USD",349.99,50,14.29,615,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBWZJFG","2767.50",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Samsung X5 Portable SSD - 1TB - Thunderbolt 3 External SSD (MU-PB1T0B/AM) Gray/Red","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WHxWq9liL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
