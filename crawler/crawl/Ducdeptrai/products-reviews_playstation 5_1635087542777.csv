I thought I'd get it now for ps5... It has to be just as good, if not better... right? I was blown away by how unplayable this is. The bugs are so bad you can barely call it a football game. Gameplay is so far away from reality it's like fortnite made a football game. Some examples:- You thought you won a regular season franchise game? Nope‚Äîbug says you lost 30-0 and all your stats from the game are deleted.- You thought you were tackled to the ground? Nope‚Äîbug says you can get back up and run again.- You thought throwing to an open receiver in the endzone was a good idea? Nope‚Äîbug says it might hit off of him, travel 5 yards to a defender, have him catch it, and boom the camera angle suddenly changes to midfield (despite everyone still being near the end zone).- You need to punt the ball? Nope, just kick it into the end zone and you might get a touchdown.- You thought you're running zone coverage on defense? Nope‚Äîbug says one of your defenders might just stop somewhere in the field to leave the receiver wide open. Same goes for your receiver running routes because they might just randomly stop for a second.Plenty of more bugs out there. You can watch all of these bugs on youtube as well. Why wait for patches to a game EA might not even fix? I'd only recommend buying it so you can return it to send a message to EA.",true,1,7,"16","B096NGLW78","playstation 5",true,49.99,"USD",69.99,20,28.58,295,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096NGLW78","1298.00",false,false,false,false,"Madden NFL 22 - PlayStation 5","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51hS3LBHdiS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I was lucky enough to receive a perfectly functioning DS5 with my PlayStation 5, the controller model is the newer of the two current variants.When shopping for a second controller, I purchased one brand new from Amazon in midnight black. When it arrived, this model is the older of the two variants. The left thumbstick was creaking in various spots and felt like it had areas of resistance in the range of motion. Amazon was kind enough to send a replacement that arrived the following day. The replacement is also the older variant of the DS5 controller, however, this controller is perfect.Long story short, if you purchase one brand new from Amazon and it creaks, squeaks, or doesn't feel as it should, request a replacement.

No extra software needed.","Always been a big fan of playstation controllers as opposed to the xbox controller, so when sony released this work of art I had to try it. Now I don't play on console. I play on PC. Which makes this controller versatile. If you do have a PS5, obviously this will work with it. If you want to use this with PC, this also works with PC. It's pretty simple to hook it up to your PC (given your PC has bluetooth.) This is how you connect it to your pc.Turn bluetooth on (on pc)Hold the create/share button WHILE holding the PS button on the controller until the controller starts blinking.On the pc, click on add bluetooth devices.Select ""bluetooth""The pc will begin searching for bluetooth devices.Once the controller is found ""wireless controller"" will show up as a selection.Select wireless controller and it will connect. The controller should light up dark blue.Launch Steam. The controller should now show up as a light blue.Now open steam and go into steam settings.Click on controller, then go to ""general controller settings"" select ""Playstation configuration support"".At this point steam knows you have a controller connected and it should appear under ""detected controllers""Now launch your games! If you don't ever turn bluetooth off, then the next time you turn your pc on it should connect right away. If not you just press the PS button which turns the controller on and will connect to your pc automatically, (unless you have a another device connected etc)With steam you can change the colors of the contoller also, so in my case when I turn on my controller it goes from dark blue to light blue and finally green.This by far is one of the greatest controllers I have held in my hands. My hands are normal sized, and this doesn't feel too big or heavy. It feels premium and the seemless conection between my PC and controller make me recommend this to everyone who wants to play games with a controller on their pc with NO extra software!",true,1,15,"114","B08FC6C75Y","playstation 5",false,69,"USD",0,0,0,34240,4.8,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FC6C75Y","164352.00",false,false,false,false,"Playstation DualSense Wireless Controller","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612bjwBuobS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R15HLI3YNC47RM","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2021",3,"Bad Writing and Wokeness, other than that, pretty great!","This game looks great, feels responsive, and improves on the movement from the first game. A lot of the traversal things you needed to unlock in the first game are available from the get go, like being able to do a high jump running start, etc.The new powers of electricity and invisibility are fantastic and you will use them a lot. The stealth gameplay is a lot better in this game.I like a lot of the characters in this game like Miles friend Ganke, but some not so much. I also enjoyed a lot of the story elements and the passing of the torch.My biggest/Only problems with this game are the writing and some ""woke"" stuff.The main antagonist is very horribly written in the latter half and without spoiling anything, has a lot to do with miles. I will include a spoilers section below on my issues with the story. Not only her, but also some other things as well.Also, going back to the woke part in the game. Early in the game, theres a rally. There, you literally meet a deaf person and right after that 2 l3sbians, like it is really forced. Some people will say whats wrong with that, nothing inherently except the latter part, but it is clearly pushed in your face and because they are in later parts of the game as well.Then they got the B-L-M wall in the game and they force you to interact with it because after you finish all the phone app missions, they put the suit they make you right underneath it and it has like 2 different camera pans just showing the wall like ""Yeah, that's right, this is good and we believe it and we need you to know and see and were so good"".Also the Danika stuff was so cringe and I am glad you're able to just disable her permanently, sadly though not for the construction site missions that makes absolutely no sense why she is involved, like she's some master reporter hacker on the case.Overall, the combat and movement were improved from the first game, had some great characters like Miles, Ganke, prowler, cool missions and side stuff, etc. Really its just the writing/woke that makes this a 3/5 for me.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SPOILERS BELOW: WRITING ISSUES:The writing in the 2nd half with tinkerer was awful. Her not telling Miles about anything, then when he figures it out, she gets weird that he doesn't want to tell her anything, when she was lying and hiding the whole time and he figured it out without her confiding in him. Then her intentions and trust are just stupid for no reason, then she literally bombs like 1000 cars and possibly kills hundreds of people and just an overall awful person, then ""sacrifices"" herself in the end as if she is this amazing person.
