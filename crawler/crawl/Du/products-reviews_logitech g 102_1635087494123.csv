Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches.

"RT1J0SNBACNSC","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"Completely useless for my target purpose (gaming)","I've had a SteelSeries Rival 310 for a couple of years now and am perfectly happy with it, but then I found out about this model which seemed like a straight upgrade to me after watching and reading a couple of reviews. After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,7,"17","B08176SM7C","logitech g 102",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split Trigger Buttons...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

Great if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate.","When compared to the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate , after 1 week of use:TLDR - Scroll wheel and LED upgrades are good.But... the +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone. No way to adjust resistance. I really wish they had kept that feature.Some people wont like the change to the weight, but I wont mind it.With all that said, if you never owned the V2 / Razer Basilisk Ultimate, you'll be happy with this mouse.",true,1,10,"110","B09C13PZX7","logitech g 102",false,69.99,"USD",0,0,0,70,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C13PZX7","315.00",false,false,false,false,"Sponsored Ad - Razer Basilisk V3 Customizable Ergonomic Gaming Mouse: Fastest Gaming Mouse Switch - Chroma RGB Lighting - ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JKqNxaZkL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

The Basilisk's shape isn't as comfortable for my hands as that mouse, mainly because it's lacking a little in size compared to the MX. This mouse is much nicer for gaming though as there are more DPI options, and honestly the clicks seem a little more responsive for gaming.The software control for this mouse is good, but I feel it's not as responsive as the wired Basilisk V2 that I had was. This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly. Honestly, I think V2 looks a little bit more classy because it's not leaving an RGB shadow behind by default.Still I think the V3 is overall a better upgrade over the V2 because of the infinite scroll wheel.

"R2PG62VIJT9QPW","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2021",1,"Arrived broken","Mouse is a bit heavier, and the mouse buttons a bit more (aurally) clicky and (physically) bouncy than the mice I'm familiar with (that being both cheap ones and ones in a similar price range to this one). I'm actually having the impression that $5 mice have more responsive buttons, due to the delay that the ""bounce"" of the buttons causes.I believe the clicking is about on par with a mechanical keyboard in volume.The cable is fluid enough, but a bit shorter than all the other mice I've used [making it impossible to reach the top of my desk from the back USB ports, forcing me to plug it into the front], and a bit draggy if you don't give it a bit of coil by the mouse [though still less draggy than a heavy stiff cable].The mouse wheel isn't especially pleasant to use, due mostly to an uncomfortable surface design. The middle button actually felt more like a proper mouse button than the left and right ones, and seemed responsive enough.Basic assessment aside, my experience with the mouse was overall a disaster. Upon hooking it up to my PC, the mouse failed to respond properly on any surface I put it to, as well as to both rapid and carefully inched motions.Regardless of attempt, it alternated between having a sort of delayed, jolting response to motion [the cursor basically hopping across the screen in a manner usually reserved for when your system memory is locked up] and having making shorter but similarly delayed jumps that then flickered a bit around the initial stopping position. Thus, in the first case, you have to guess where it'll land and, in the second instance, you might be able to get it to land near a button only to flicker off by a cusror length immediately after.I downloaded the management software for the company's products, but clicking the executable took me to an install confirmation prompt that, when accepted, simply vanished without actually proceeding to any kind of installation. Top quality, that.Looking at the software images provided in the Amazon listing, I notice that the sensor has a bright red glow similar to all other mice I've used. For the mouse I received, I had to put my eye right up touching the mouse just to see a very faint glow deep inside the mouse. With that in mind, I'm inclined to believe my issue was less one of general mouse quality or software configuration, and more of having a faulty sensor light.Either way, even if I did simply have a defective mouse, the overall quality of the mouse simply did not impress me for its price range. As I noted at the start, nearly every component of the mouse was far lower quality than I was expecting. The only redeemable parts- the grip/surface and the middle button, were simply average in quality, not notably standing out against budget mice.In the end, this mouse had nothing to offer but massive disappointment.",true,1,11,"111","B07H3GFJJ2","logitech g 102",true,24.99,"USD",29.99,5,16.67,2973,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H3GFJJ2","13675.80",false,false,false,false,"HyperX Pulsefire Core - RGB Gaming Mouse, Software Controlled RGB Light Effects & Macro Customization, Pixart 3327 Sensor ...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/413jb9SWLPS._AC_UY218_.jpg"

I do prefer the Razer Viper Ultimate over this because I prefer the texture and shape. I am also bothered that a $150 computer mouse looks almost too simple. Also, in my opinion, the Viper Ultimate doesn't feel that much heavier than this. I wanted to note that, in case anybody wanted a cheaper alternative.Overall, this mouse is a flex, or for anybody who wants to go out of their way to spend time and money on their gaming hobby (gaming career maybe?). I considered buying this since it launched and was not disappointed. Here's to hoping I get my $150 out of this mouse.",true,1,12,"112","B087LP6F4Y","logitech g 102",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,1913,4.8,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087LP6F4Y","9182.40",false,false,false,false,"Logitech G PRO X Superlight Wireless Gaming Mouse, Ultra-Lightweight, Hero 25K Sensor, 25,600 DPI, 5 Programmable Buttons,...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ykKLbddNL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse. If you have large hands (especially in length), I highly recommend this mouse because you can claw and fingertip this mouse comfortably, and maybe even palm grip.

The leather on the wheel and the wheel itself feels very very nice and sturdy. The buttons are a little cheap though, but that's okay.It has some quirks that you will eventually notice though, not tooo big of a deal personally though.Eventually after regular use, the wheel may start squeaking/hissing when the wheel is turning left.You may run into the problem where the wheel becomes off center, this is usually due to you turning too hard to the left. To fix it, just turn to the right all the way lightly, then just push a little harder and then you'll feel something shift back into place.It's actually really hard to press the shifters behind the wheel if the wheel is turned, since it's locked relative to the wheel. It would be a lot easier if the shifters were attached to the wheel base instead, so they didn't move when you turn.The clamp is a little lackluster, if you turn too hard sometimes the wheel will slide a bit, if you're really going at it I've had it come off of the table. That's rare, and only if you're aggressively drifting on a car with low torque and turn radius haha. None of that applies if you get a rig for the whole setup.Overall, good for the price.
