The keyboard feels heavy and solid, so I had confidence in it working well and being reliable. However, lately the space bar has been acting up. It 'duds' sometimes causing the space bar to not travel straight down, especially when hitting it off center towards the right side.This is very annoying as space bar strokes are almost by definition (two hand typing) off-center. This is definitely something with the underlying mechanics in the keyboard or the stabilizing mounts.This has become a real nuisance, I am with some regularity missing entire space bar strokes, which is sadness, I liked this keyboard otherwise, but I am afraid I will have to junk it, missing 1 out of N key strokes is simply unacceptable.POST EDIT: I contacted the seller who advised to remove the space bar and clean the stabilizers, which didn't really help much, but now I have a 2nd problem that the Caps Lock and ESC keys sometimes output garbage which could either be indicators of dirt or short on the circuit, or a break in the circuit?It looks impossible to clean this keyboard internally without desoldering the whole thing, remvoing the external housing doesn't do much other than concluding that the board and is inaccessible, so if there were an issue that can be fixed, there is no way to get there",true,1,5,"14","B0875ZJZXB","keyboard IKBC CD87",false,79.99,"USD",0,0,0,280,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0875ZJZXB","1260.00",false,false,false,false,"iKBC CD108 V2 Ergonomic Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Brown Switch for Windows and Mac, Full Size Keyboard Upgraded w...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NUI1h95ML._AC_UY218_.jpg"

""Small"" keycaps.I was reading through the Amazon reviews on this keyboard and I was somewhat alarmed by the one that complained about the size of the keycaps.These keys are a very normal size.They width of the top of the key is .515"" according to my calipers (13mm).2.) With or without number pad?So I use this keyboard with either a mouse or a touchpad sitting just to the right of the keyboard.Since I use the mouse/touchpad so frequently, I find that the reduced distance I need to travel in order to get to the keyboard/mouse is wonderful, so I recommend omitting the number pad.I have a second keyboard that has a number pad that I can pull out if I have a bunch of number data entry to do, but for daily typing tasks, I don't feel like I'm missing much by not having the number pad.3.) Feeling of the key action (aka the switches).I got the Cherry MX brown switches.They seem great, but I'm not a mechanical switch aficionado.I would love to have tried them all out side by side, but I'm happy with the browns.They aren't too loud, but they're definitely not silent.My laptop keyboard and my other keyboard (Microsoft wireless bluetooth keyboard) are both virtually silent.4.) Typing speed.I type pretty quickly, and although I feel like I'm still getting used to this bad boy, I find that the responsiveness is very good, and I did a quick typing test online to see the how I was doing on the new keys.The Microsoft keyboard requires quite a bit of force to depress each key.The Cherry browns are definitely a much lighter actuation force.I found that I was immediately able to type about 15-20% faster which I attribute mostly to the lighter key actuation force and the solidity of the keyboard.5.) Build quality.Last thing I'll mention is that this keyboard is heavy.It feels well built and I suspect that it will last me for a long long time.Maybe (hopefully) a lifetime.6.)

"R8YQ1G7VUH60Q","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021",5,"Phenomenal! ...But Takes Some Getting Used To","Okay so I absolutely love this keyboard, no doubt about that now. It wasn't like that at first though.I initially purchased the keyboard for my first gaming desktop PC (avid longtime PC gamer, putting in 80-90 hours every week on average back on my gaming laptops) and I liked the black/white aesthetic that matched my PC and speakers, but also because of its minimalist design and THE VOLUME KNOB <3Upon first getting it and using it however, I found myself accidentally pressing other keys by accident because they aren't spaced very far apart and don't take a lot of force to press. Honestly I almost considered returning it after a few days because I hated all the misspellings I was making and having to correct.After a few weeks of usage though I suddenly realised that I wasn't making misspellings hardly at all anymore and my fingers had already memorised the placement of all the keys so I don't even look at the keyboard when I type now.So for anyone who just got this keyboard and is having a similar issue, just stick with it for a few more weeks and I promise you it gets better! For anyone on the fence about it, just be aware that you may have this issue at first but like I told the current users, you get used to the keyboard after a short while!Alright here's the Pros/Cons list: The Cons: - The narrow spacing between keys can lead to some accidental key presses in the early days of getting used to the keyboard - It isn't wireless (this may or may not be a con for some people, I personally don't care much) - Um... I think that's it?And the Pros: - Typing is pretty quiet compared to a lot of other keyboards! My roommate said he was glad I switched to this keyboard finally just because he could finally read in peace haha. Combine this keyboard with the Emopeak silent mouse and you've got a nice quiet setup, though that mouse may be a bit small for some people. - The ever-so-silky smooth volume knob! I honestly can't get over how nice the knob is. It has the perfect amount of resistance when turning it, its metal construction makes it feel very premium, and if you want to mute the volume, you can just press it down to mute instead of turning the knob to the left. I refuse to get another keyboard that doesn't have a volume knob. - The individually-backlit keys! There's plenty of lighting pattern customisation, from the speed of the animations to the brightness as well---and of course there is the ability to have the keys constantly illuminated or not at all. - The ability to set a PIN to unlock the keyboard when turning it on--to prevent any unwanted users accessing your keyboard/PC - Low profile makes it a good entry-level keyboard for long-time laptop users wanting to get into the desktop world. - Very portable since it has a low profile, isn't very large, and the USB-C to USB-A cable is detachable. - Media control buttons in the top right of the keyboard! I'd've preferred the Play button to be between the Previous and Next buttons instead of the button order being Play, Previous, Next. They still work great though and I love using these in conjunction with the volume knob when listening to music. - Also the calculator button, right next to the media control buttons. Didn't think this was something I'd put on the list of pros for a keyboard review but honestly I use it far more often than I ever thought I would. - Great build quality! I saw a previous 1-star review saying that many keys stopped working for them after a few weeks or months of use but I've been using my keyboard for 12-13 hours almost every single day now for over a year and I have had absolutely ZERO problems in all that time.So I'm not sure what that person may or may not have done to their keyboard or if they just happen to have received a faulty model but their case about their keyboard is definitely not something you should expect to find with your keyboard.Who knows, maybe they didn't read the manual and accidentally locked themselves out of their keyboard haha.Features: 10/10Ergonomics: Initial Use - 6/10, Later Use - 9/10Build Quality: 10/10 (so far still holding up with no issues whatsoever over a year later of constant usage)Portability: 10/10Would Recommend: 13.5/10",true,1,8,"17","B082FTSMNP","keyboard IKBC CD87",false,94.99,"USD",0,0,0,51,3.9,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082FTSMNP","198.90",false,false,false,false,"iKBC Typemaster X410 White Backlit LED Mechanical Keyboard with Cherry MX Low Profile Red Switch for Windows/Mac, Full Siz...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61FSVQ1JkxL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R25L1ZPR35O8VQ","Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2020",1,"Key switches failing after 3 months - can't recommend","Pros:This keyboard has a nice feel to it, the key press is just the right weight and was a pleasure to use - for about two months.The volume control knob is exactly what I wanted and the reason I bought this keyboard in the first place. To many times have I gone from one video with super quiet audio to another that wants to blow my speakers. Having an audio dial that accessible is the solution I needed.Cons:I have at least three key switches that are causing issues after 3 months.The tab key either doesn't work at all or ""bounces"" (detects multiple triggers when only struck once) and sends multiple tab keys. As someone who uses tab to move between fields when filling forms and auto completing text, this has become quite a nuisance. Autocomplete in gmail has turned into auto-send an email before I'm done typing it.the shift key (and yes that non-capital at the beginning of this sentence is the issue) fails to work about one in ten times. Half the time I catch it and go back and have to fix it - slowing me down.The ""j"" key is super sensitive meaning if I brush it when putting my hands on the keyboard or while typing around it, I end up with a random j in the middle of the page.In short, I can't recomjmend this keyboard.

Enter the iKBC cherry mx red tkl keyboard. Even after using mechanical keyboards for almost a year now, I still prefer thesatisfying tactile feedback of brown switches, nonetheless, the typing experience on the iKBC takes a little getting used to if you are coming from more traditional keyboards. The 3 biggest differences for me were the height of the keyboard (very comfortable without a wrist rest), the size of the keys (they look like they have been squashed down by Wreck it Ralph) and the unique sizing of the spacebar, enter and backspace keys. The keycaps are not that great and have no texture on top. They are quite smooth and if you have any moisture on your fingers, it will show a glossy reflection on the caps. This keyboard is so silent, especially for a mechanical keyboard! and It comes with a volume wheel. This is the only reason I spend an extra $25 on this keyboard over another low-profile tkl that uses a micro usb connection.

I have been hunting a descent backlit TLK keyboard with Cherry Silent Black switch type for years. Most MK doesn't offer this switch type, which leaves me frustrated. The moment I found this Durgod Taurus K320 TKL with Cherry MX Silent Black was the moment that a dream finally came true. Major keyboard companies would sell an MX silent red, a lighter version. Whereas the Silent Black variants usually lost popularity and went out of stock. What a nightmare for someone like me - someone who plays the heavy keys. Those butterfly red switches are just not my taste.Speaking of the build quality, the best descriptions are sturdiness and elegance. I love the font of the letters on the keycaps. They are simple, clean, and professional-looking. I seriously dislike the lousy and overly exaggerating fonts founded on the keycaps of other brands' gaming keyboards. The keycaps are a perfect fit for the Cherry MX switches, made of double-shot PBT. They feel great to type on. In sum, I love this keyboard for two reasons. First, it offers a rare switch I enjoy. Second, the build quality is excellent.One minor problem I have is that the included USB-C to USB-C cable seems to be flawed. It doesn't have a very stable connection to my laptop and randomly disconnects. Amazon resolved it for me by giving me a new USB-C cable for free.

"RMO9GLIWBKZ6Y","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2021",5,"One of my favorite keyboards yet!","Over the last several months, I've really gotten into portable mechanical keyboards. The K320 is my 5th such keyboard and is by far my favorite! Though more expensive than some other options,BUILD QUALITYWhile the frame is plastic, it's a very durable plastic that is quite rigid, giving an overall ""well-built"" feel. There's no appreciable ""deck flex"" even with good pressure. The included keycaps are solid - with some other keyboards that I've bought on Amazon, I've noticed that the keycaps can be quite thin - with clear printing. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't have any issues with the quality of printing on some of the keys. The included USB C cables seem well-built, though braided cables would've been a nice touch. Overall, though, the board seems durable, and I'm not worried about its ability to stand the test of time. 5/5PERFORMANCEI went with the Cherry Brown switches. This is my first board with Cherry Brown switches and I absolutely love them! Very nice tactile feel with a satisfying - but not deafening - click. They're heavy - and I do notice that my typing is about 10% slower compared to ""faster"" switches - but for long typing sessions, I do prefer the heavier actuation weight of the Brown switch.Other than the switches, this board performs as-expected. I haven't had any issues with an unstable USB connection, missed key presses, or any other issues with the individual switches themselves. This board is an absolute pleasure to type with. In fact, I bought it originally for my office, but I ended up loving it so much that I took it home and used one of my other keyboards for my office instead.I didn't try Durgod's firmware update tool so I can't speak about issues related to firmware upgrades. I didn't really see the point since I didn't have any issues with the board out of the box. 5/5OVERALLIf, like me, you're on the quest for a perfect keyboard for your PC setup, put this on your short list. While I haven't entered the premium keyboard market - which I would define as $150-200+ - this is definitely the best keyboard in the $100 or less price point that I've tried so far.

Again, returning this as well and getting the G502 wireless.Logitech needs to rethink their branding for this keyboard/mouse.

There were actually some brownish red stains on it.It looked a little like dry blood.I was able to wipe off most of it.I am not sure what it was but hopefully nothing to worry about.Inserting the switches were easy and everything worked painlessly.My biggest downside is the build quality.Honestly the build is quite bad.I am not sure if I just got a defective unit but one of the acrylic plates particularly the one on top sadly seems to be shorter than the others in a noticeable way as can be seen by my photos.Actually all the plates seem to be slightly off in size and dont align perfectly.But honestly it's not really a deal breaker for me. I am still satisfied with the purchase but I think its worth mentioning.It does still feel quite solid with little flex.Just as an FYI.I am using Kailh Box Jade Switches with cherry profile pbt keycaps.Overall despite my issues, I can still recommend this keyboard.It is mostly because there arent many other options like this that are readily available.I do wish there was some better quality control.I mean, the PCB shouldn't have had any mystery stains on it and the acrylic plates should have been better aligned or at least the same size.",true,1,14,"113","B083H1RBHZ","keyboard IKBC CD87",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,12,3.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083H1RBHZ","43.20",false,false,false,false,"hot swappable YC66 PCB Custom Mechanical Keyboard RGB SMD Switch LEDs Type c USB Port with Acrylic case RGB Side Light (YC...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rJ-wpu7FL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
"R14OWSDADGHT93","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2020",5,"Fantastic value","I'm swappin' switches like everyday. Lovely and sometimes OVER THE TOP rgb effects. The acrylic frame is great. Lube the stabilizers when you get it in and the thing will sound great! It's plastic so no case ping. South facing LEDs and support for all varieties of switch pin configuration. The only downside (and it's a doozy for some) is that it's not programmable. Not just the lights, but the inputs. I would love to reprogram the insert and delete keys to function as home and end, but I cannot. I think you can flash this to work with QMK, but do so at your own peril. You do have the ability to control volume and can access the function keys utilizing the function key + number row. If you're a programmer - forget about it! If you're a casual typist and gamer - you can really explore all of the keycaps and switches out there quite easily with this handsome board. Works great on Mac or PC.Comes in a nondescript case from china with two switches keeping the pcb in place. The USB C to A cable is fine. Oh, and you can turn off the RGB entirely.I really think this is a fabulous value if you lube the stabs and do not need key or RGB remapping.Enjoy!",true,1,14,"113","B083H1RBHZ","keyboard IKBC CD87",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,12,3.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083H1RBHZ","43.20",false,false,false,false,"hot swappable YC66 PCB Custom Mechanical Keyboard RGB SMD Switch LEDs Type c USB Port with Acrylic case RGB Side Light (YC...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71rJ-wpu7FL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

But this maybe a con for someone else.I have seen this issue on many other reviews and I have the same major issue.

I do not eat anything near my keyboard and have never spilled anything on my desk, so figured this was unlikely but decided to try anyway. I pulled the key off, saw nothing on the board nor within the key itself, used canned air just in case, put it back together, and the same issue.If cleaning didn't work, the second option was to force the keyboard into ""CRP_Disabled"" drive and sent me files to replace the firmware.bin. Since I tried this, following their instructions step-by-step, my keyboard no longer works at all. No lights, no response, nothing. I tried different USB ports, reset my computer, tried a different computer, nothing. I can get it back to the ""DRP_Disabled"" drive but that's it.Not happy.
