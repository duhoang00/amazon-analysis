"R3JN8RTBH5N81U","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2021",4,"Where has this keyboard been my whole life?","I have been a Mac user for the last decade, typed on many types of keyboards. I recently tried a number of cheaper membrane keyboards, but never found one that I felt at home on. I had started seeing all the hype and talk about mechanical keyboards and was curious as to what all of the fuss was about. After doing some research, watching more YouTube videos than I care to admit, I took a leap and purchased a Keychron K3.As far as fit and form is concerned, I can honestly say that I love this keyboard so far. I opted for Blue Gateron low profile, non-hot swappable switches as I figured if I don't really like the feel, I'd send back and try something different. I am in my own closed office space, so noise is not a factor. Though, I will have to mute my mic when in virtual meetings and need to type notes.Two not so positive observations:1) I had read a number of not flattering reviews regarding the Bluetooth connectivity. I have found that connecting to my iPhone is ok, though my Dell XPS 13 has not been so crash hot.2) this be a peculiarity of the Gateron switch, but when you press down a key past the 'click' point, and then partially release it back up, you can actually continue to press it all the way back down and register clicks. I was under the impression that it had to fully release and go back down past the 'click' point to register the next keypress.Other than that, the key layout is a little different that what I am used to. I find myself missing the Backace key and landing on the '=+' key.

"R2ERQ372NMP7RX","Reviewed in Australia on March 24, 2021",,"Takes a little getting use to but it's a great little keyboard","These brown switches feel more stiff than the cherry brown switches I have on my corsair keyboard. But thats not low profile and so maybe thats the difference. Though it still feels like it's tougher than it should be.Otherwise this is a very neat nifty compact low profile keyboard. Loving it so far, been using it for about a day now and so far like the extra space and no numpad on the right.The low profile and space between the keys feel perfect otherwise.Notes for improvement:* Windows and Mac symbols on keys rather than actually having to replace them to get the symbol/icon for windows on them I switch between mac and windows very regularly and will not be swapping the key caps every time.* Some macro options without the use of software like the cooler master k622 does.* Though the width of the keyboard is great, I find I keep hitting the arrow key instead of the right shift. So maybe for me a layout like the K1 but with the low profile and design of this K3. Or better yet something in between as I would like the del and ins to be separate keys.Finally this would be 5 stars if the keys felt softer or not as stiff to press on these brown switches and insert and del being separate keys with a full width right shift key.UPDATE: Weeks of using it now at my primary keyboard.* Still find the keys a little stiff compared to my corsair cherry mx browns* Switch between mac and windows mode is very annoying and not very easy to switch. I switch between mac and pc very often. Wish the switch was like switching between bluetooth devices, or easier then the switch on there now. Though I'm getting use to it I feel like I'm going to eventually damage it and not be able to switch between pc/mac. Question is which mode will I be left in when that happens. Anyways, really hoping it won't get wrecked.* The size and spacing have been great.* The active bluetooth is wonderful, switching between devices has been instant once active.* Would have been nice to configure the idle time before it turns off. It also turns off after 10 mins when connected via cable and using bluetooth. And turning this feature off is not a good option as the battery has not been so great on this device.Hoping for a Keychron 3 rev 2 with the above addressed, be the perfect keyboard for me if that happens.",true,1,3,"12","B08LYKWB5Q","keyboard keychron k3",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,26,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LYKWB5Q","117.00",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K3 Ultra-Slim 75% Layout Wireless Wired Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys RGB LED Backlit for Mac Windows, Low...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71KT0A6-cjL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

"R2LAX6MXG4RH8F","Reviewed in Australia on August 16, 2021",,"Amazing first mechanical keyboard experience!","Absolutely in love with my Keychron K3v2 Keyboard with Optical Red switches!This is my very first mechanical keyboard as I've always used membrane laptop keyboards prior. It didn't take long to transition and I feel like my accuracy has improved, my fingers are still moving at lightning speeds and can spend longer periods typing without fatigue. As a first mechanical experience, the keys are very 'bouncy' and I sometimes don't need to bottom out to register the keys. This could be a little sensitive for heavier typists out there, but it shouldn't be a problem if you are a light touch typist like me.I also like its hot-swappable capability so I can try out brown and blue switches later down the track :) The sounds are less silent than laptop keyboards, but they sound like you are being efficient and feels ASMR! There are lots of RGB effects to choose from and the size is perfect for me, compact for on-the-go and has all the keys I need. There are also two back legs to change the angle of the keyboard. The function keys are also easily accessible on the F row like volume, pause/play, brightness, etc. There is also Bluetooth and cable mode, switchable with Windows/Mac. The cable mode makes the RBG lights brighter and has no lag compared to the Bluetooth mode (I see some lag when it wakes up from Sleep mode, which I have now turned off). The keycaps are low profile, so they are quite easy to take off without the keycap puller tool provided. I have tried using the switch puller tool too and it works well if you squeeze the switch tightly top and bottom before pulling it out.All in all, I am loving the experience, typing more than I ever have and being more efficient with my work!

It needs to be more clearly advertised that the switches are not hotswappable. All switches are soldered on. Which is fine if this was a great keyboard out of the box, but:2. The stabilizers on this thing are BAD. Like, very mushy and unresponsive. The spacebar sticks constantly. Unless I absolutely slam it, I have a 50/50 shot of my keystroke actually registering. The other keys using stabilizers are mushy at best (e.g. enter, backspace, shift).The spacebar is relatively important, and the end result is a very bad keyboard. I will be ordering the hotswappable version direct from keychron's site because I think this would actually be a very good keyboard with upgraded stabilizers.

"R21O5PWH3RJWTR","Reviewed in the United States on September 29, 2021",5,"Solid Mac-first keyboard, with only a few caveats...","Since I needed new peripherals to go along with my new M1 Mac mini last November, after years of typing on flat MacBooks, I decided to finally treat myself to my first mechanical keyboard since the original IBM PC was offered with one.After a long online dive, when I surfaced I had decided on the 75% Keychron Wireless Backlit RGB with Brown switches and Aluminum Frame.For me, these Browns by Gateron are an acceptable compromise between mechanical feel and reasonable noise, just as long as you are okay with the lack any actual mechanical ""break"" when actuating. I prefer not waking up the house late at night!That being said, I do sometimes still miss a clearly felt mechanical actuation feel, but this works for me, and is still legions ahead of any membrane keyboard, or Apple's own.IThe keyboard is rather tall, but not exceptionally so.I use it with the rear feet extended for a more sloped typing angle, which helps.I ordered the matching Keychron Wooden Palm Rest in anticipation of this and it makes a big difference when I do serious typing.I also prefer the feel of the finished wood on my palms over spongy fabric covered palmrests, or the bare glass top of my desk. When just casually surfing the web or doing other non-typing-intensive tasks, I put away the palmrest since it just tends to get in the way if I have to move the keyboard around and have desk clutter.Bluetooth is rock-solid, with never a glitch or delay, ever.In fact the connection is far more reliable than with Apple's Magic Trackpad 2 that I bought at the same time.If I recall, I think I had to use a wired connection just once, to be able to boot up my brand new M1 Mac mini.This is a condition specific to only the M1 versions when using a non-Apple keyboard on a new machine.The RGB color options and patterns, though entertaining as heck at first, end up becoming more of a distraction after a while.I ended up using one preferred color pretty much all the time. Keyboard circus lights can be distracting!A note on the colors, specifically blue.Normally a color I might choose, this blue is not very bright, even when turned all the way up in the dark.I always end up using the brightest setting for all the colors, all the time, to get to a decent brightness level.Except for blue.I find it far too subtle.in my photos I use cyan/teal, which I like very much.Battery life with the RGB lighting activated is an issue, but it's addressed in the descriptions when you buy it.Expect to get a full day's use out of it, then plug it in overnight so you're ready to go in the morning.With the illumination turned off, it's much longer, maybe a few days.After nearly a year of use, I can say I am still satisfied with my purchase.I wish the lighting was a tad brighter, and the rubber on one of the folding feet has disappeared (a much bigger problem on the Keychron Palm Rest on which ALL of the pads slid right off it's base - a BIG problem since it'll wobble without!), but not enough suffer any buyers remorse.The keycaps still look good with crisp lettering, and they haven't acquired significant shine from use yet.Battery life is as purchased.it still looks and types great.Whether or not you consider it's reasonable cost vs. comparably featured keyboards from some others, it's a worthy purchase.Except for that one rubber foot-pad... When one falls off, you know more will eventually follow.Especially when you consider how awful they were on my Palmrest.I tried everything to get them to stick - unacceptable that they all fell off within a few weeks of purchase.Keychron, you make some good gear that I'm comfortable recommending to others.I want mine made right again; how does one get replacement feet, please?",true,1,7,"16","B07YB32H52","keyboard keychron k3",false,0,"USD",0,0,0,2623,4.6,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YB32H52","12065.80",false,false,false,false,"Keychron K2 Wireless Bluetooth/USB Wired Gaming Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys RGB LED Backlit N-Key Rollover Alumin...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/614chmBNoqL._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Been using a Kira for the past couple of years and before that, I had a crappy (but handsome) Excalibur 75% kb, this one is very nice. The only things I don't like about the keyboard is:- Lights reset whenever I switch machines or switch to Bluetooth. I have the keyboard attached to a KVM switch, whenever I switch the KVM to another machine. I'm not big on keyboard lights as I don't use shine-through keycaps. So it's pointless to have them on- Bluetooth is severely borked. It lags, types randomly by itself (usually the last key you pressed), its especially annoying when it gets stuck on backspace as it will delete everything you've typed until you hit another key.- The plastic case is plastic. I would have loved either a low-profile case or a metal one. I would have paid extra for either of those options. That being said, although it's plastic, and looks rather cheap, it's pretty solid and doesn't make weird plasticie noises when typing.If you use this keyboard with it plugged directly, it's great!

Honestly, I didn't even know they weren't in the keyboard to begin with, but only after I started using it, I found out that it wasn't there, which impacted my productivity heavily since I have them bound as shortcuts and macros for other programs. So for me, the removal of those keys was the killing catch, but to other people who may not care about the keys and only use the keyboard for gaming or everyday use that's not for productivity, then it would be a solid catch, but this keyboard just isn't for me.
