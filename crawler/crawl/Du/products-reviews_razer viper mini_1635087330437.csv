No creaking in the frame, mouse feet are very smooth, is very light for being wireless, and the sensor is great! But there are two things that really bother me about this mouse that has made me sell this mouse and buy another mouse. First, the switches are terrible. They are cheap Omron switches that do not feel as good as other switches (i.e Razer Viper Mini, which is ironic because it costs $30). If you are going to buy this mouse, learn soldering skills and switch these out for some Kailh 4.0 or 8.0 switches. Second (and biggest issue for me), the shape. When you first grip this mouse, you feel like you are gripping a potato. I have medium sized hands (17 x 9.5 CM or 6 3/4"" x 3 1/4"" IN) and I prefer to claw grip my mice, which I cannot comfortably claw grip this mouse because it is too long and too tall for my hands. If you have medium sized hands in length, fingertip or palm grip this mouse but don't claw grip this mouse. If you have large hands (especially in length), I highly recommend this mouse because you can claw and fingertip this mouse comfortably, and maybe even palm grip.

I'm not a fan of the changes to the button internal switches and how they feel or sound.Pros: I like the changes to the scroll wheel. No complaints there. I like that they finally copied one of the features I loved about older Logitech mice. The LED zones on the bottom of the mouse are sweet for you RGB fans (which you probably area if you are buying this).Cons: (It's hard to know if these are little defects with the specific mouse I got, or all V3s are like this). I'm not a huge fan of these upgraded switches for the buttons. I liked the way the V2 felt and sounded better. These are louder and require more force to press. The thumb buttons for forward/back or buttons 3 and 4, feel and sound different from each other. It really annoys me. And the new version of the button 5 or the sniper button, feels worse than the V2 for sure. The button has farther travel distance, feels more mushy, and does not press smoothly. Pressing it feels like the bottom side of the button angles down more than the top. I also hoped this button would be closer to your thumb than it was with V2, which for me always felt too far away and I would need to adjust my whole hang to press it. With the V3, for better or worse, its in the same exact place as the V2.I'm actually debating buying another one to see if the switches feel or sound any better, and then return the worse of the two.The +/- resistance option for the scroll wheel on the underside of the mouse is now gone.

This mouse is much nicer for gaming though as there are more DPI options, and honestly the clicks seem a little more responsive for gaming.The software control for this mouse is good, but I feel it's not as responsive as the wired Basilisk V2 that I had was. This is mainly with regards to Razer's Chroma software. I tried to have the bottom portion of LEDs disabled, but it can be pretty laggy or buggy as an effect. The main reason why I tried to turn off the bottom portion of RGB lights is because it can be pretty distracting. The lighting around that area looks totally badass, but the reflection it makes against the surface looks kind of ugly. Honestly, I think V2 looks a little bit more classy because it's not leaving an RGB shadow behind by default.Still I think the V3 is overall a better upgrade over the V2 because of the infinite scroll wheel.

Everything worked as it should. The cord was not a problem and extended long enough to reach my tower. I enjoyed having two buttons on the side for gaming purposes. The mouse fits nicely in your hand. The scroll wheel and the design light up a pretty white hue. Aesthetically pleasing and matches my white set-up.BUT. After 3 months, just this past September, the scroll wheel started to make this OBNOXIOUS screeching sound every time I scrolled. I didn't realize how much I scroll until this started to happen. It was ear aching and I looked up how to fix it, saw that MANY others with this mouse had a similar problem, and the fix requires you to dissemble the whole thing to oil it. I am not savvy with that so I left it alone in hopes that it would just go away with time.Well the squeaking has reduced but now everytime I attempt to scroll, it causes my window to jitter and scroll back the OPPOSITE way. So here I am battling with my mouse to scroll smoothly for just a couple inches.

"RT1J0SNBACNSC","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021",2,"Completely useless for my target purpose (gaming)","I've had a SteelSeries Rival 310 for a couple of years now and am perfectly happy with it, but then I found out about this model which seemed like a straight upgrade to me after watching and reading a couple of reviews. After getting it out of the box, I was excited to test it out in my favorite game, DOTA 2. Very quickly however I found out that unlike the two side buttons of the Rival 310, which are extremely easy and super natural to press, all 5 of the side buttons of the Rival 5 were exceedingly difficult and unnatural to press, and also led to mouse movement due to the force required to press the buttons. Also, my thumb had to be in a very weird and cramped position to be able to press the side buttons at all. The big forward side button was basically impossible to press, and the up/down rocker was very difficult to press as well. From the natural thumb resting position, it requires a significant movement to be able to press even the closest two (""back/forward"") buttons, unlike with the Rival 310 where those buttons are basically instant-press as soon as you think about them. Therefore, this mouse is completely unusable for playing Dota 2, and I would guess any other game.I have medium to slightly large sized hands, and I would imagine someone with very large hands / long fingers, or some specific grip style might be able to use the side buttons (I am using a standard grip), but for me they are completely unusable. Again, the Rival 310 side buttons are perfectly usable so I'm unsure why they decided to move them way out of reach.The other features of the mouse are fine, as is the build quality, although I heavily dislike the default-on lighting, and the fact that the RGB lighting settings are NOT stored on the mouse itself, so if you use it with a different PC or laptop on which you don't have the SteelSeries software installed, you are forced to have your mouse glow super bright in random colors. The cable is OK too.I hope they make a ""real"" upgraded version of the Rival 310, with more side buttons, that are natural to reach, like the two existing ones, and not this ""apparent"" upgrade which is really a huge downgrade.",true,1,13,"113","B08176SM7C","razer viper mini",false,29.88,"USD",0,0,0,3548,4.5,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08176SM7C","15966.00",false,false,false,false,"SteelSeries Rival 3 Gaming Mouse - 8,500 CPI TrueMove Core Optical Sensor - 6 Programmable Buttons - Split Trigger Buttons...","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71EOtRi-c6L._AC_UY218_.jpg"

Feels good for my hands, but your mileage may vary. That's basically where the good experiences end for me though.After a day of using it, the signal would cut out for seconds at a time. Tried a different usb port, tried a different machine entirely, it's either the dongle or the hardware in the mouse itself. Ok no problem, switched it to bluetooth and it worked for a bit but also would cut out occasionally though not as often as over the dongle.Ok, so I began troubleshooting. I downloaded the software and updated the firmware, which didn't help anything really, the mouse still had signal issues. Also of note is that the steelseries pc software is one of the more buggier third party apps I've experienced. At a certain point I needed to jump through hoops to get the mouse to update the DPI profiles properly like rapidly switching back and forth between bluetooth and radio in order to get the software to finally push the updated config to the mouse.So where does that leave you? Well, it's a crapshoot like 9 out of 10 modern ""gaming"" products. These companies cut corners somewhere, and usually a safe bet for them is to skimp on quality control.

"R37NEA2RQ5YJM9","Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2021",5,"Low profile high performance mouse surface","I bought this to replace an 8-year-old Razer Sphex skin, which was almost identical other than the size and design. The Sphex was being used on the tiny computer desk in our family room. I like having a low profile mouse pad on that desk which doesn't stick out. The Sphex did well considering how much use it got, and how my daughter liked to lift up the edges and crease them with her nails during online class until tiny pieces eventually tore up bit by bit.I like the design of these pads. The Sphex was accurately called a desktop skin, which is what it is. This new one's called 'thin mouse pad', which can be misleading. It's basically a piece of plastic that's smooth and tacky on one side (to stay in place), and textured on the other side to give good mouse performance. This new version has a cloth 'tag' that you can use to pull it up and reposition it. These are very easy to reposition, but only as long as you keep the tacky side off the table as little as possible so it doesn't collect dust, and make sure any surface you move it to is cleaned thoroughly. You also have to be careful not to crease it, since any crease on this material is permanent and will always show. For all these reasons, this is NOT appropriate as a travel mouse pad.I was initially worried that the design on this would be too bright, but the actual mousepad has more muted colors than in the pictures. Overall I highly recommend it.",true,1,16,"116","B01N7R3OZ9","razer viper mini",false,7.99,"USD",0,0,0,8364,4.4,"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N7R3OZ9","36801.60",false,false,false,false,"Razer Sphex V2 - Mini - Ultra-Thin Form Factor - Durable polycarbonate finish","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71m7H-gPPYL._AC_UY218_.jpg"
